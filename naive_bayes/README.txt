Please replace the absolute paths of all files. Visit the train.py file to see how the naive base model is
trained and stored into airline.nb. Then, visit baseline.py to see how the conditional probabilities are 
utilized to generate the baseline_predictions.txt file. Finally, visit the accuracy.py file which is located
in the parent directory and replace the file variable("mine")'s path with the path for baseline_predictions.txt.
