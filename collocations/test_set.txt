@USAirways churn rate increasing by the second

@USAirways @JosephTReis Dont bother. They dont pick up the phone. Worst customer service going
@USAirways overloads small plane with extra baggage and then. Has to take them off... Poor execution #4435, 75 minute delay...
@USAirways might possibly be THE WORST airline ever! I think it's time to brush up on customer service! #sorude
@USAirways , I am embarrassed for us air and their inability to manage during weather delays.handling of # 4435 is an example
@USAirways are the bags off Flight 1898 CLT to JFK? We landed last night just before midnight.

@USairways E190 lands without nose gear in Houston - @Flightglobal http://t.co/Yf9NhMwyFF

@USAirways 4097 DCA to BNA. Just told they need to do 1.5 hrs worth of maintenance. Was supposed to leave at 8:50 am. [sigh]
@USAirways why now just announce delay of 4478 from PVD when you knew captain was already on delayed flight coming in? Frustrating
@USAirways any updates on Flt 1848, here at the gate and they have no expected time of departure
@USAirways this travel day sucks but Malcome K at gate 39 rocks.  This guy is the brand you want to be. Replicate his approach and style.

@USAirways Hooray! I've now been on hold for over an hour. I've never loved Southwest more.

@USAirways I better get a free flight
@USAirways @nm4agoodlife      5 hours on hold and no answer . Guess the synergy of a merger was really planned out
@USAirways still waiting on your reps to show. Now 40 mins into waiting in below freezing weather waiting for a cab.
@USAirways @_RobPrice  how can he try again it will be 5-6 hours before he gets help.  Contingency plans non existent.
@USAirways delayed depart bc ur flight attendant wasn't there. Then after landing took 3 hrs to get a gate. Now it's another he and NO bags
@USAirways @jtrexsocial 5 hours on hold ... Safe to say no one is working .
@USAirways But every time I call I'm on hold for 45 min and then get disconnected. Any way someone can help?
@USAirways surely there are some other ways to help me - I can't really afford another 4 hours now. Pls follow me so we can DM
@USAirways I was on hold for 2 hours and still no answer. Is this really how you run your business? http://t.co/P8xFhq4kps
@USAirways keeps dropping my call and won't even let me stay on hold because they are "too busy" #idontwanttocallback
@USAirways I never made a reward reservation becuase no one ever answered the phone. The online one I made got Cancelled Flighted and I can't change
@UsAirways can a real person help me here? This customer service is poor. I'm at the mercy of someone since the flights are disappearing.
@USAirways I intend to..very much. My 4,000 followers will as well.
@USAirways Your customer service is  non-existent/ terrible. Dozens waiting for bags not placed on our flight, no staff anywhere #neveragain
@USAirways even alternate options are allready full...even with hotel voucher...no more room in philly?
@USAirways @traveloneworld .. Utterly frustrated after 4 hours on hold call was disconnected. I need to amend a Flight Booking Problems. HELP! OW Emerald
@USAirways ok thank you! Very helpful! This is why you're my favorite airline!
@USAirways They provided no options. Since you all have a better sense of the weather, I hoped you could suggest.
@USAirways you airline is doing rather poor right now. In SLC waiting to take off. Was suppose to take off now 2 hours and 3 minutes ago!
@USAirways Get new planes then. Got on this plane at 7:50 its 10:20 now and still on tarmac. How ru going to compensate me for this?
@USAirways just hit 4hrs.  what is typical wait time right now? should i drive 2h30m to the airport service desk?
@USAirways are you going to do anything to help stranded travelers of flight 680?! No communication from anyone. All of us dumped here.
@USAirways question is why flight took off at all, now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city
@USAirways in a few weeks
@USAirways #Wronganswer. Talk is cheap. Customer service is the action of making things right for the customer. #fail again.
@USAirways 4 hours . How do I change my flight that was Cancelled Flightled ?
@USAirways You won't give us a hotel or food. Can you at least suggestion options for making it to the metro city I have a ticket to?
@USAirways actually it landed in BWI 30 minutes ago. She is stranded but I have friends to help. You FAILED big time on this one.
@USAirways I have been on hold for over one hour waiting to reschedule a flight. How much longer should I expect?
@USAirways its fine. 

Just wondering where my money went...
@USAirways You landed me at #BWI instead of @Reagan_Airport  and have no plans for me to make it home to DC. How do you suggest I get home?
@USAirways stranded at BWI after two diversions. No cust service, no transport. Dumped here. Terrible customer service!
@USAirways As a member of the news media, the awful service of the last few days won't go unnoticed.
@USAirways My wife, sick 3yr-old-twins, and I have been waiting in line now for 2hrs to see an agent! Phone agent said nothing til Tuesday!
@USAirways This is garbage, been trying to book a reward flight and then it got Cancelled Flighted and still can't get anyone on phone. Unacceptable
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled flight 1796 baggage held hostage at CHL. No communication.
@USAirways Delays due to faulty engine light. Great work guys. Coming up on 2 hrs sitting on the plane #WorstAirlineInAmerica
@USAirways yes - tells me the only way to mod plans is to call the 4322 number.
@USAirways Can I book award travel on Etihad with Dividend Miles?

@USAirways what's going on with passengers diverted to CLT on FLL to PHL flight that left at 830 tonight?
@USAirways on top or having to check my bag I had to wait over 30 min for my bag to come out at baggage claim. Thanks for wasting my time
@USAirways I had to sit in your kitchen and move stuff around so I had what I needed. I'm extremely disappointed in your service
@USAirways been sitting on the tarmac for 90 mins now bc engine is broken. How are u going to compensate passengers #WorstAirline
@USAirways it was your fault the flight was delayed to begin with. I shouldn't have to check my bag if there's a bunch of space
@USAirways it is an extreme inconvenience to make ppl check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. You lie so you're not at fault
@USAirways stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS
@USAirways no more hotel voucher? Everyone had to get one but not me...what do I do? Arrived from Amsterdam #SnowStorm
@USAirways Yep, except this delay was due to a hasty and unwise decision to pushback other plane before the plows were done. #fail.
@USAirways by far the worst airline in history. I'll never ever fly your garbage again
@USAirways pullin some sh** delaying flights again... Smh @OBJ_3 http://t.co/Av2rfFHMcV
@USAirways @PHLAirport flight 837 landed at 10:30 pm and we are still on the plane. Help!!!!!!

@USAirways flight 837 passengers stuck on plane in Philly. Where is the gangway?  We can't hear the pilot
@USAirways 2 hours and counting waiting to get into a gate in Philadelphia. Just icing on the cake for a miserable flight experience

And it says I have no trips coming up??
@USAirways help! Flight Cancelled Flighted, can't call because my phone doesn't work in Europe. Please help? Says I'm booked want to confirm.

@USAirways @AmericanAir how do I get thru on hold over 3 hours ?
@USAirways is flt 680 en route to DCA or BWI after diverting to RDU. Your phone service  sucks and your website is conflicting.
@USAirways how do I change flights . 3 hours is crazy please help
@USAirways how do I get thru on hold 3 hours 5 minutes . Is this normal ? My call is lost
@USAirways weather doesn't excuse poor customer service, lack of info from staff or the fact staff haven't turned up
@USAirways please help on hold 3 hours can't change flights I'm stuck here
@USAirways on hold 3 hours !!!!!! What's the number to speak to someone this is unacceptable I need to change flights
@USAirways - My guess is what happened in #Vegas ended up in #Philly #Sexy http://t.co/qgMfCB7yT4
@USAirways he waited over two hours on the phone, had to book and get to MI, family member very ill, time of the essence
@USAirways depart from where? It departed PHX and was due to land at DCA around 8pm.
@USAirways Can't stress enough how awful the agent was for flight 5283. Knew 11 ppl from delayed flight were on way in mins, no compassion.
@USAirways I certainly understand the hold delays for WX reschedules - I've been on for 2hr15min - do you have an estimated wait time?
@USAirways And cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed ON TIME for 45 mins. Still didn't get half the luggage.
@USAirways likelihood of PHL to BDL actually leaving tonight? 2 hour delay so far!
@USAirways My brother &amp; his family stranded in CLT tonight bc gate E36 agent wouldn't hold plane for two minutes. Now driving in bad weather
@USAirways over an hour is unacceptable wait time. thanks for nothing.  Be sure never to fly you again
@USAirways Thanks guys! Got hold of someone. Really awesome service I appreciate it :)
@USAirways understood. It simply feels as if the staff is not being entirely truthful about the situation.
@USAirways #not happy, wife 40th Bday trip. would like to be fully compensated for both flights
@USAirways delayed in philly since 130, sitting onTarmac since 8pm flight 1881 plz contact donaldaroberts1@gmail.com
@USAirways worst trip ever!  Wish pilot would've let me off plane at 12pm during 1st delay.  Now 1030pm and still sitting on runway.
@USAirways First class service on US 769 PHL-MCO today from the flight attendant in F. I didn't catch her name but she was top notch!
@USAirways so far no call back
@USAirways Oh well. I'll get to Cancun eventually.
@USAirways standing in line with 100 people all looking to do the same
@USAirways cannot book to redeem companion fair without speaking to agent. $99 vs $1200, this is a family emergency #unacceptable
@USAirways can I at least get a response?  I tried the gate person (sent me the wrong way to cust srvc ) Cust Srvc (when I found them)
@USAirways That's clever. Its clear you need more agents. 94 min hold and counting. Flex workforces are highly possible in 2015
@USAirways hey folks where do you hide luggage when you Cancelled Flight a flight! You have 100 very angry people with no luggage
@USAirways can I get an update on flight 680 to DCA?
@USAirways you can send my luggage to my houseüëã
@USAirways Eyyyy! Cancelled Flightlations, Flight Booking Problemss, reFlight Booking Problemss, but y'all got me on the same flight out tonight (not tomorrow) &amp; the FC upgrade. Thx!
@USAirways thanks for letting me know of the 12 hour delay and 2 hours on hold ?
@USAirways please respond to me. I've been on hold on the reservations line for an hour and 45 minutes. I would really appreciate it.
@USAirways From here on out when I can at all I'm flying @Delta. Since when is a plane getting stuck in a drift for 2 hours a weather issue?
@USAirways on hold for 1 hour and 14 min trying to find the luggage flight Cancelled Flightled where is luggage? http://t.co/i1SfMI7zat
@USAirways Never mind that you could have told the gate I was on my way - you could delay 10 mins but not 15?
@USAirways  and now I'm going to miss my G'ma's Memorial because I didn't #FlyDelta.
@USAirways @usairways -Really? U land me in Philly 1.5 hours before my flight, wait 1.5 hours behind a plane you got stuck,
@USAirways Your app and website are trash AF.
@USAirways not best pleased with service so far. On our third gate and still no guarantee that it's the correct one :(
@USAirways Don't want to clog your already-crowded line with a special meal request. Can someone DM me to sort out? #vegetarianproblems :)
@USAirways I should also add the weather conditions are terrible. Expecting 18 inches of snow. Any advice?
@USAirways I'm on flight 623 from DIA to Ontario tomorrow morning. no access to the airport via taxi or shuttle. What should I do?

@USAirways How long before departure do gates stay open? Will I make my connecting flight 1861 to RDU from flight 894???
@USAirways So you Cancelled Flightled my flight AGAIN? are you paying for my hotel?!
@USAirways something is wrong with your phone system if you call someone and don't play the recorded flight notification. Is US643 Late Flight?
@USAirways I'm flying with you this Summer. Will I be able to leave Miami Airport during my 12 hour stopover there?
@USAirways the plane crew has been as professional and courteous as the gate agents were flustered.
@USAirways hell is terrible gate agents. And a three hour wait at the gate.
@USAirways I made the change online, but couldn't check-in online, so had to call (3 hrs on hold btw). Shouldn't have been charged $25
@USAirways your ticket agents at gate 4 in Providence airport rocked tonight, especially Kristy, sorry if that is not the correct spelling.
@USAirways #ShoutOut 2 Kristie(sp?) from Gate4 @ PVD today. She's a #RockStar, was a tremendous help in a tough situation. #PromoteThatGirl

@USAirways an already pleasant flight from London to Charlotte (US733) was made fantastic by an amazing attendant. Thank you so much Robert!
@USAirways @AmericanAir won't even refund for a flight they Cancelled Flightled #horriblecustomerservice
@USAirways call dropped &amp; no call back...another 45min-hour for another rep. The worst CS ever, online, by phone &amp; in person.

@USAirways will you fly me to somewhere warm? I'm tired of this snow! :(
@USAirways why the hell u left *alliance and joined 1world is beyond me not a smart move time to start looking at other carriers
@USAirways and apologies are thin when you don't even offer hotel vouchers to your stranded customers.
@USAirways I did. They told me it was a 40 min wait &amp; they'd call back. It's already been 45 min. Horrible
@USAirways but only for certain flights from CLT-NYC. The notion that you can't rebook customers for 48 hours is absurd.
@USAirways had to Cancelled Flight 4 of my flights because my versace biceps wouldn't stow completely under the seat in front of me.
@USAirways disappointed with your toll free number. Terrible customer service, my flight has been Cancelled Flightled would like to get home
@USAirways it a change fee request from a month ago.  after one hour on phone with your team, I‚Äôm told 120 day backlog.  Awful.

@USAirways woohoo! He still has 1 more flight but so happy to hear they're in the air, just about cried! (Must be the preggo hormones!) thx!
@USAirways status shows "delayed" it was just "waiting for takeoff" so did it depart? It certainly didn't at 4:17pm. http://t.co/emRUbu4WzD
@USAirways you're right it's not fun. Especially when I don't have much of a choice. Lol. #curvygirltravels
@USAirways can you help us figure out our correct six digit confirmation number?
@USAirways AND my rebooked flt isn't until Monday??  AND I don't get a voucher for a hotel?!  Never again, US airways.
@USAirways Thank you!!! This whole crew has rocked through bad weather and diversion. Pilot keeping us well informed. #customerservice

@USAirways already did. I travel for a living, no help at all that it will take 3-4 weeks for any repair. And I have to pay to ship to TX.

@USAirways ...be found when he checks in. Now no info. Please DM me and help me fix this NOW. (3/3)
@USAirways to a booked hotel for the night so I had to find him a room at midnight. Then say his bags will be on the plane, but can't (2/3)
@USAirways This is ridiculous. You delayed my husband's flights &amp; made him miss his connection. Told him to leave his bags. Sent him (1/3)
@USAirways Been tweeting with the team at @AmericanAir who informed me that the problem is that you never sent his bags to them yesterday.
@USAirways- can you tell me what the policy is for preboarding with small children? Is that still a thing?
@USAirways Your Baggage system has hung up on me twice because you have too many callers. I NEED TO FIND MY HUSBAND'S (@SweetingR) BAGS.
@USAirways haven't eaten all day either so lemme get that CC# so I can buy a burger across from the terminal.  #DoBetter @UsAirwaysSuck
@USAirways looking forward to waiting on hold for 9 hrs to reschedule my flight.  Bunch of idiots work for this airline.

@USAirways you are cutting into my pregame time.  Go @KentuckyMBB !!!!
@USAirways Can't wait for the trip. Thanks for getting me there!
@USAirways What's the seat assignment policy? Why let us choose a seat only to change it on us two weeks Late Flightr?
@USAirways Yes, it's February. Bad weather happens every winter. If you guys don't have the business sense to forecast that I'm at a loss.

@USAirways had baggage lost last night, no call from us airways and no bags and nobody answering phone #badcustomersrvice #whereismybag
@USAirways if my flight's been Cancelled Flightled, and I can't reach anyone over the phone or ticketing agents, safe to assume I wasn't rebooked?

@USAirways the American Eagle plane you're using for CLT to RDU is disgusting! You should be ashamed! #disgusting #ew http://t.co/B4xhiRuGzV
@USAirways undermines the intelligence of customers by ignoring their complaints with their copy and paste canned responses #usairwaysfail
@USAirways providing poor customer service by responding to complaints with a copy and paste tempLate Flight unreLate Flightd to complaint #usairwaysfail
@USAirways I've been on hold for over 2 1/2 hours - there has to be an easier way to Cancelled Flight/get a refund... üòëüò© http://t.co/Cm4roIypc2
@USAirways enormous lines at customer service and two agents what kind of service is that .. http://t.co/ffanixJhwh
@USAirways Inexcusable behavior by gate agent. Sorry isn't enough. #Flight850 #CLT-#BNA
@USAirways chose you for a flight with very time sensitive arrival And you drop the ball. What gives? CLT #667 good way to lose my business
@USAirways I'm trying to Cancelled Flight my flight within the 24hr window but have been on hold for over an hour. Is there an alternate # I can dial?
@USAirways i've been on hold for an hour trying to change my flight!!! COME ON
@USAirways what happens if the flight takes off before we Cancelled Flight?? That's the issue. We don't want to pay because of your inaccessibility!
@USAirways I'm assisting @marccopely. He is already rebooked. Agents rude, unhelpful, discourteous. #FrequentFlyers appalled. Unacceptable!!
@usairways  this is ridiculous at CLT  and we missed our connecting flight because of a chuckhole  on runway??  #shameful (1/1)
@USAirways Look at that. The flight I have been trying to book for 3 days is gone. I guess someone got through. Thanks! Keep up the #Failing
@USAirways no one at #clt knows about runway issues..my inbound flight was only one delayed..connection left without me..now I'm stuck!

@USAirways how do you have only 1 flight into lexington this afternoon with the #1 @KentuckyMBB playing a big game tonight?  #DoBetter
Hey @USAirways based on the number of retweets and likes on my FB post, it's nice to know I'm not alone in my frustrations with you guys!
@USAirways seems to be the only airline without a dedicated line for status members
@USAirways Flight 1815 (N747UW) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @PHLAirport http://t.co/TtLwZgIyAg
@usairways I just learned that although there is travel policy and they waive the change fee-you will still be charged a $25 reservation fee
@USAirways Stars aligned. Connecting flight was delayed into CLT. Made it! Thanks, glad to know someone is listening. Time for 80¬∞ in MoBay!
@USAirways if one with @AmericanAir why can't you use American miles????
@USAirways why cant Sapphire members reach anyone on the phone?
@USAirways gold desk quoting me $900 to rebook due to weather. Can buy first seat on same flight for $440. Why? On hold for 45+ mins now
@USAirways @PRof_Solutions Be prepared for 3+ hours hold times
@USAirways Sadly your words don't represent your company's actions. Talk is cheap.
@USAirways trying to Cancelled Flight a flight urgently...get hung up on twice??? Sweet refund policy
@USAirways @SeanVRose Sean - keep in mind if you call...plan on being on hold for 3+ hours
@USAirways - what is your policy regarding large-size passengers who cannot fit into a single coach class seat?
@USAirways "Owen F" at DCA Gate 42: #rude.

@USAirways Official time of call 3 hours 10 minutes but must add for 7 minutes your reservation agent was extremely professional and helpful
@USAirways - I'm currently missing a basketball game due to your lost bag policy #terribleservice #wheresmyrefund
@USAirways your flight attendants are all jerks üê≥
@USAirways Easily the most ridiculous experience trying to spend money with your company.
@USAirways Was told it was a software bug. Told to call back this AM  Now your system is too busy to handle any calls this AM.  Clown shoes.
@USAirways - been on hold with reservations for over 30 min already! #worstairline
@USAirways now the 3rd issue with the plane is a fuel leak. They will let us know soon what they decide. #getmeoffthisplane #ineedabeer

@usairways when trying to check-in online, it says to call...now I've been on hold for 2 hours...what to do?
@USAirways how long are you going make us sit in this plane while they repair it? Could I at least get a beer???
@usairways I've been on hold for approaching 2 hrs for an issue when I changed my ticket online. Frustrating.
@USAirways on hold for 1hr, 30min. Not willing to hang in there as long as @franchise02. @AmericanAir answered in 7 min. U are not 1 yet.
@USAirways what's the point of email stating I didn't get bumped to 1st class? I know I'm not in first class, I booked the regular ticket
@USAirways 2 hours and 7 minutes. Just want to know I'm still in the queue...
@USAirways check in at St. Louis is so rude, even the TSA is nicer than them.
@USAirways so disappointed. Least you could do is give us access to admirals club for an hour before our flight to our wedding!
@USAirways paid to upgrade to first class, went up to Admirals club at PHX airport to be turned away because our flight is to CUN and not MC
@USAirways can you please post wait time-have been on hold for two hours
@USAirways Saying my friend missed her flight when she clearly sat next to me on the plane &amp; now you're Cancelled Flighting her flight home.. WTF!?
@USAirways or is anyone even responding to social media? AWFUL.
@USAirways a big thanks to the gate agent flt5127..keeping us informed of the delay#greatcustomerservice
@USAirways I'm on vacation, This is the LAST thing I want to be doing. Is anyone even answering the phone?
@USAirways I fucking hate your customer service. I've been on hold all morning trying to figure out why you Cancelled Flighted my flight.
@USAirways DCA to RSW at 8:30am Cancelled Flightled.  Rebook to Charlotte Cancelled Flightled.  Can we rebook selves online???
@USAirways how do I find an email address regarding reativation of dividend miles. Nothing on website
@USAirways baggage drop at phl b/c is incredibly backed up... unacceptable service
@USAirways we're glad to hear it. Out of curiosity, what causes such flight patterns?
@USAirways trying 2 fly frm DCA to SRQ to visit a family member in hospice but 4532 was Cancelled Flightled, can someone assist me?
@USAirways I don't want a reservation change, just adding a service. Am going public with this to get help.
All followers please note that @USAirways is not taking customer service calls, nor responding by helping via soc. media #dontflyusairways
@USAirways your checkin at @PHLAirport is a #shitshow, and the agent behind the counter who tried to send me to the wrong destination=rude!
@USAirways Sitting on the runway at phl for the last 30 min because the correct weights for the flight aren't in the system? #jobfail
@USAirways So no idea? Thanks...
@USAirways any guesstimate on hold times? Can't change my flight online, at 45 mins and counting...
@USAirways Trying to change my flight due to NYC travel advisory... your online system Cancelled Flighted my entire flight. Been on hold for over 1 hr
@USAirways yes. But the manner with which it was done was harsh for those affected. Already checked in. No remorse. Weak alternatives.
@USAirways ok. Thank you
@USAirways told to work it out ourselves #joke #fail
@USAirways incapable of seating a 2yo and mom together. Toddler in his own row #fail @CNN
@USAirways bumping people off a flight ten minutes before takeoff because the flight is overbooked #fail
@USAirways you call this a window seat? #airbus321seat14Fproblems http://t.co/ZKOE6clGiU
@USAirways is there a number to call to modify reservation.  Please help. Very frustrating with american and us air merger
@USAirways you've completely ruined a pro athlete's ability to prepare for a race. Now you won't help him get the bike he needs to the DR?!
@USAirways Cool. Now @SweetingR has been told you can't re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race.
@USAirways quick, let's board a plane so that we can sit on runway for 2 hours #clockwork #scareways #neverfails @AUmilo1
@USAirways Also, get excited, because he's going to be unable to contact you all from his destination, so you get to talk to me.
@USAirways flight 705 FRA-CAT did some odd zig-zagging movements over Frankfurt...
Is everything ok?
@USAirways It's pretty hilarious that you want @SweetingR to finish his awful experience before doing something. Make it right, now.
@USAirways u would think if u were going to Cancelled Flight my flight, you'd rebook our seats to something other than the last row. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways no online clearly states I can NOT- It says to call res. I already explained that.
@USAirways dealing w fam emergency. Was told was rebooked this am to AA flight 4297 out of ORD and now it's not in system. Need help ASAP.
@USAirways Got it, thanks!
@USAirways Umm, can you define 'extra time'?
@USAirways International
@USAirways Oh yes, because I had loads of time running to my connecting flight after you delayed me for about 90 minutes...
@USAirways Hey, my bag was damaged flying with you yesterday. What can I do?
@USAirways landed at Phoenix, but we had to board a flight quickly to Vegas so no time at the airport. What now?
@USAirways I left something on a recent flight today. Who do I contact to retrieve it please? Thanks!
@USAirways @AmericanAir flight 849's four subsequent delays destroyed my travel plans this evening. Looking to resolve this matter.
@USAirways I did at 7 pm! Still no bag..
@USAirways Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up.
@USAirways Congrats, you've just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold &amp; $25.
@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
@USAirways Not only did u lose the flight plan! Now ur flight crew is FAA timed out! Thx for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #Pathetic
@USAirways I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call?
@USAirways ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight!
@USAirways hey guys just want to say I had the best flight ever! Thank you so much. I fell asleep and actually had a wet dream.
@USAirways Can you help me update KTN on the profile?  Ticket book via AA &amp; that info didn't get pass on.  I've been on hold forever
@USAirways so you're not honoring miles with @united that were traveled last year?
@USAirways you need to check information regarding hotels, shuttles, re routing flights, delayed flights
@USAirways I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father
@USAirways How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
@USAirways &gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service.
@USAirways It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime
@USAirways REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea?
@USAirways I'm glad you're sorry that I'm homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure.
@USAirways but in the meantime I'll be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st.  Thanks guys!
@USAirways ah, and I was only given one shuttle voucher, so if I do ever get back to the airport you'll be getting the bill
@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
@USAirways but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief.
@USAirways but don't worry! They found a hotel, it's only 45min away. I got there around 11:30pm, no problem.
@USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough
@USAirways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to "go left" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there
@USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami.
@USAirways No worries I was able to read @stephenrodrick entire book while holding. #TheMagicalStranger
@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip
@USAirways flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is Cancelled Flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours.
@USAirways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn't even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed
@USAirways Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn't allow to make change online?
@USAirways @stephenrodrick Your team needs to build capacity
@USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible.
@USAirways -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold &amp; disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won't go-HELP!!!
@USAirways Made about 30 calls to USAir today to merge of AAdvantage, Dividend Miles. Each time, says call back Late Flightr. #30timesenough
@USAirways fuck you.
@USAirways I'm dumping this dividend miles card and forgetting your airline exists #ridiculous #theworstairlineever
@USAirways How dirty does the damn plane have to be to take an hour to get the plane cleaned??? Refund me my milesüò°. #wasteoftime #theworst
@USAirways worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you.
@USAirways Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN
@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?
@USAirways - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks
@USAirways Kudos to Robin at @PHXSkyHarbor Lost/Found for reuniting me w/ my iPad. She was delightful to work with!
@USAirways Website won't let me change online even though airline issued travel advisory, now on hold for 50 minutes. Help.
@USAirways  you were always my go to. What happened?  Airbus over Boeing, and now no customer service?
@USAirways trying to change flight because of airline travel advisory. on hold for 45 mins. Help!
@USAirways Can you help me add a AAdvantage number and known traveler number to a reservation?
@USAirways would be less annoying if road conditions weren't getting worse with every min U keep passengers captive for no good reason.
@USAirways experience exceptional service from Cherry at #DenverAirport.  #GreatService. #professionalism
@USAirways literally the worst flying experience of my life, and I have flown a lot
@usairways I purchased a $49 upgrade on a flight 2 weeks ago and you gave it to someone else but I have not received a refund. Is this SOP?
@USAirways figure it out, have had 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in the past week. Now coming home 2 hour delay, and cart that pulls plane just broke
@USAirways 45 minutes on hold no help
@USAirways transferred 4x pleeeeeeeease help!
@USAirways me too!
@USAirways flight #3797 treatment of passengers has been atrocious - over 2 hours delay only to now deplane and given no direction
@USAirways I have corporate-paid travel in April. Is it possible to purchase an upgrade to first class now?
@USAirways you can thank supervisor Jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided
@USAirways only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That's pretty awesome if you ask me...
@USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family
@USAirways that's who I spoke to already. We've already booked another flight w/someone else. Thanks for your concern. Just wanted to
@USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.
@USAirways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there?
@USAirways @keithlaw  I flew US Air for the first time yesterday, got propositioned by the flight attendant....true story!  #Creditcardsales
@USAirways 13 years of Naval Service and I run the travel department for all my commands...
@USAirways US Airways website. So you double charge people when they book flights now? Apparently you have but I've never been booked twice
@USAirways Already tried. How about Conf # via DM
@USAirways new slogan should be "if you don't want to arrive on time, pick us"
@USAirways you have to be crazy! Treated my mom very poorly. Not happy! #usairwaysfail
@USAirways they weren't able to without reFlight Booking Problems and recharging the amount plus $25 fee for help over phone. Spoke to 2 agents &amp; Jeanine
@USAirways I will send an email with details Late Flightr. Thank you for responding.
@USAirways This is the last time I use your airline. I promise that!
@USAirways @AmericanAir did I mention I'm a silver preferred member and fly every week (not always with you), and not even a meal voucher?
@usairways Need to change div miles ticket after travel started due to weather advisory. Told not possible unless flight Cancelled Flightled. AnyHelp?
@USAirways @AmericanAir I was supposed to get from fresno to pittsburgh by 10pm.  Instead I'm now not getting in until 4pm... tomorrow
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm stuck in the airport in fresno trying to beat the storm to pittsburgh, and you guys have offered nothing. HORRID
@USAirways hello I have a question for you and your phone lines have jammed
@USAirways @AmericanAir u are the worst airline ever figure out the merger #dontmakemegooutside
@USAirways Just to follow up here is my experience: http://t.co/WJIiGZtiwg
@USAirways / @AmericanAir are incompetent.
@USAirways Now the next plane had a broken seat!  My row!  Another hour delay!  #mad
@USAirways how can I make a purchase, you take the money but I don't have a reservation...Explain
@USAirways @AmericanAir are u paying incedentals? #noworstairline
@USAirways @AmericanAir thought u merged but #USAirways sucks #worstever http://t.co/myNZitCovn
@USAirways yes I did thank you! They did a great job turning the flight in jan !
@USAirways  2 hours on hold and issue still not resolved. hope to make my flight in 12 hours. for every minute of talk = 20 minutes of hold
@USAirways connection made. Thanks again this week. #daddyshome
@USAirways worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together.
@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
@USAirways im on the plane not sure what you mean. We are sitting here. It's just one story of failure after another when I fly you guys
@USAirways still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory
@USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out.
@USAirways them and @AmericanAir
@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
@USAirways @AmericanAir terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing.
@USAirways I did &amp; was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle.
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
@USAirways it's not misjudging it's a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers
@USAirways - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week.
@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
@USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
@USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered
@USAirways yep, check it and my gmail 'Promotions' folder regularly... :-(
@USAirways  is a bag that is   23‚ÄùL x 9‚ÄùW x 12‚ÄùH  allowed as a carry on?
@USAirways thanks for nothing
@USAirways there is nothing tonight and I am on the flight now with GOGO internet is there a way that someone could send me a DM or email?
@USAirways 2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let's hope this plane works. I'm tired.
@USAirways Good info, but am already signed up for all options.  None of which sound like they applied to the 'missing' emails.
@usairways is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia Sc than making me stay in CLT over night after my delayed flight?
@USAirways thank you
@usairways and @american please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue
@USAirways it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. "Please wait" then same form.
@USAirways found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times.
@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled.
@USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone.
@USAirways if you get my bag from E Gate to B Gate at the Charlotte airport before my 6 pm flight (Late Flight cause of yall) I‚Äôll ride US for life
@USAirways It's a debit card, but I am a Dividend member.
@USAirways nothing important to do.  Why was I told to wait in the @AmericanAir line?  #patiencerunningout
@USAirways How do I redeem my pass to the admirals club? I have 1 free visit with my barclay card membership. And can I bring a companion?
@USAirways Almost home ...East Coast Freeze headed to PHL connect AVP TGIF http://t.co/WXowZhpgfL
@USAirways @AmericanAir can someone please tell me who I have to talk to #getittogether #findurgrip
Is it insulting that @USAirways @AmericanAir offer a "non required $50 voucher as a goodwill offering..At least my bag can fly round trip
@USAirways there is a travel advis for nyc and phil PA  -winter weather- but U.S. Air hasn't posted one yet. Can I still change flt wo pen?
@USAirways I'm trying to Request Missed Mileage and it keeps saying it can't my flight from 2/13. Then it says call the number.
@USAirways flight 413 my carryon is missing.stollen off plane or left at gate. Worst customer service. Doesn't seem to be anyone's concern.
@USAirways how about checking the plane before having everyone board the plane? #pissed
@USAirways Used 2 get emails 1) pre-purchase a snack and 2) when time to check in. Got neither 4 tomorrow's trip. Do they not get sent now?
@USAirways link didn't work via Mobil.
@USAirways Wishing we had our luggage. 2 days now. Had to pay our way from St Thomas to San Juan. Spent extra $$$ because of this mess up.
@USAirways I'm not a frequent flyer with US airways, I'm qantas? Can I still get notifications? Thank you
@USAirways How do I get through?
@USAirways @AmericanAir who runs the show at the airport have a boarding pass says us airways and I have to wait in American line #yousuck
@USAirways any chance of a travel advisory or DCA this weekend?
@USAirways Yes thank you. Appreciate u checking...
@USAirways why I can't book a flight to PRN through your website?
@USAirways this is ridiculous #planebroken can't wait to board this one home 5 hours Late Flightr #neverontime #brutal #paymytab
@USAirways Yes, it was Sunday.
@USAirways since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I'm confused since we had sunny skies
@USAirways I keep calling your help line (800) 428-4322 and it keeps saying they are too busy to help &amp; to call back Late Flightr. FOR A WEEK NOW!
@USAirways who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay?
@USAirways more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing.
@USAirways I'm enjoying my flights so far! You're doing a great job. Today's been tough, so thanks for making my flights comfortable.
@USAirways look @Delta has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. http://t.co/3KhGjoFgpX
@USAirways That's not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can't help me?
@USAirways if I have Dividend Miles credit card &amp; I used it to book my flight is one bag free?
@USAirways have checked all day.  CHO needs added.  Please evaluate.
@USAirways hi there I am flying MYR-CLT-ORD tomorrow is weather looking ok or problematic?
@USAirways can u tell me if 5238 from clt to Jan has gotten out of the gate yet?  I will have a tight connection out of clt to mco.
@USAirways Please hold US1765 for me. Need to get home tonight before weather. Almost there.
@USAirways followed!
@USAirways Shavon at customer service desk in Charlotte was fantastic! So helpful and smiling evn after what sounds like long day.Reward her
@USAirways have scheduled flight Sat(2morrow) CHO-CLT CHO needs to be added to weather advisory.  Please evaluate asap.
@USAirways another squashed flight. Having to share my seat with another passenger is not@my idea of quality travel
@nrhodes85: look! Another apology. DO NOT FLY @USAirways
@USAirways it's painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! http://t.co/ocqk0JFXuA
@usairways yep, sent my bag to Philadelphia instead of Miami...I caught it...then was told my flight changed to tomorrow, wrong again #fail
@USAirways will shall see in the next couple of minutes.
@USAirways right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm.
@USAirways I did, but i need to get a human being. What's the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer.
@USAirways - Check-in staff at PHX are awesome! Great traffic control for general boarding.
@USAirways Batting 1.000! Four flights in a month, all four delayed!
@USAirways sure, just DM'ed you.
@USAirways &amp; also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, &amp; it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed
@USAirways Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer.
@USAirways #2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door!
@USAirways and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what?
@USAirways   Just talked to reservation. Must congratulation to them. Very friendly.  Good for usair. The ONLY airline we fly.
@USAirways I am just trying to establish what your policy is. Thanks!
@USAirways fight was delayed 3 hrs in MCO, now I'm stuck in Philly with a standby ticket, flight 4009. Solution needed.
@USAirways sure did. I have carried this bag on numerous times on the same style plane. Planning accordingly apparently accounts for nothing
@USAirways Know what I like about gate 35X @NationalAirpor ? Nothin.I like nothin bout yo #ghettofab gate #USAirways http://t.co/mAqw2nLNiU
@USAirways I've tried calling 3 times the past 3 days and I keep getting told to call back. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME
@USAirways gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans.
@USAirways it's vegas baby who doesn't have a good time in vegas lol
@USAirways me and my wife will be flying out of atlanta to vegas on March 7th since couldn't get any out of tricities here in Tn
@USAirways worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it's "not worth it" for them accommodate me given circumstances in BOS
@USAirways see? No response? Obviously you think this "service" is acceptable. #customerservicefail
‚Äú@USAirways: We're sincerely sorry, Sean. Reservations is working hard to answer everyone's call and we appreciate your patience.‚Äù #false
@USAirways absolutely
@USAirways It wasn't weather this morning.  AWE1701 diverted back to BOS due to mechanical issues.  So far lost one of 3 days :(
@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!
@USAirways @AmericanAir no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers
@USAirways how do I get you to stop sending me emails about my ex boyfriends account? I don't care how many points he has! He only has
@USAirways we have seats.  on phone Iwas  told I was getting error msg due to paid 1st class upgrd. told to check in after 12am.sound right?
@USAirways waiting for bags now over 25min in Phl bag claim!
@USAirways awesome! Flight #676 out of philly on Tuesday. Party in row 15 if you're interested.
@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking
@USAirways Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me?
@USAirways i got through and am able to switch my flight with no charge. Thank you
@USAirways will you please start offering more routes out of @triflight to more locations instead of just charlotte and atlanta
@USAirways Welcome to North Texas US Air / American Air employees. 
Housing and Education are great opportunities in The GR8 State Of Texas
@USAirways oh they saw it and said nothing.
@USAirways yes but lost a whole day.  Frustrating!!  #poor customer service
@USAirways Saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service.
@USAirways trying to check in online for a flight tomorrow.  Tried computer, tablet, and phone.  got error message on all devices?
@USAirways @AmericanAir How do I merge my miles accounts? Your sites tell me my info don't match even though I can't find a difference.
@USAirways yes had to go pick up and pay 40 cab ride very rude employee poor customer service
@USAirways can I bring mini bottles of booze on to my flight?
@USAirways your staff at LAX really messed up on this one. Failing to scan my suitcase tag.
@USAirways Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice
@USAirways Nice try.  Doesn't apply to Philly.
@USAirways what is your policy around bringing a breast pump on board?
@USAirways Thanks. No DC yet, I see. I will keep that link and check back. Appreciate it!
@USAirways I'm glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available.
@USAirways Will you guys be offering no-fee changes for flights out of DCA tomorrow afternoon?
@USAirways how can i get ahold of a reservations supervisor?
@USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it.
@USAirways awesome! And yes, @UpInAirClaire is!
@USAirways that website does not give correct info said my bag was in Miami was in key west the entire time..I got the run around for 2 days
@USAirways was on hold for about 45 minutes after speaking 2 lady at the airport counter. Gave up
@USAirways I just want to find my bag so I won't have to go through the hassle of trying to claim what was in my suitcase #usairwaysfail
@USAirways Literally all that says is "Case open"  What good is that to me?
@USAirways no you not sorry. I am trying 2 add a day 2 my vacation but there is a $200 charge just 2 change flights
@USAirways Melinda in reservations in greensboro nc is an absolute jewel thank her for me she's amazing!!!
@USAirways the two women workng PHL bag check term C @ 11:30 ET should be fired for being rude, pushy and treating customers with disrespect
@USAirways Best GAgent in a long time - Danny B. for US628 DFW-CLT. Appreciated how up to date he kept us during irrops. Super professional!
@USAirways 
Good news, we got fixed.
@sarahpompei don't bother wasting your time!  @USAirways will send u a form letter &amp; let u choose a gift certificate. #worstcustomerservice
@USAirways thanks is there a beareavement discount anymore or not should I just book online
@USAirways and now that flight pushed back to 2:35pm departure.
@USAirways -not just this trip, been a few. Ur saving grace is ur cheaper flights. Now willing to pay more 4 bttr service on bttr airlines.
@USAirways horrible experience to key west lost luggage called to check &amp; was told not to call back reconsidering my flight back
@USAirways thank you!
@USAirways I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I've since learned @Delta had one!
@USAirways Yes, I get that. I‚Äôm asking: Specifically, what will you do with the feedback I‚Äôve given you?
@USAirways delayed I'm charlotte big surprise
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled flight, 50 person line and one agent helping to rebook. You could've handed this one better. http://t.co/By3vDioSUA
@AndrewFallis same here! On hold for an hour &amp; then told @USAirways has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight
@USAirways what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fianc√©e are stuck in BOS!
@nrhodes85 isn't it funny that @USAirways just apologizes, but doesn't actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? #NotImpressed
@USAirways 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA.
@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????
@USAirways Thank you
@USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx
@USAirways Reservation agent on the phone did a great job.
@USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps.
@USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!
@USAirways can I book using some sort of breavement program? I need to get home for my pops funeral
@USAirways I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!?
@USAirways Thank you. But I don‚Äôt understand. What will you do with my feedback?
@USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!
@USAirways Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares?
@USAirways how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707?
@USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter
@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!
@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made
@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased.
@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
@USAirways made it!!! Send Bloody Mary's to row 27!!!
@USAirways 5223 out of Gainesville, FL
@USAirways I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back #
@USAirways Thank you for valuing my feedback. What will you do with it?
@USAirways the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday
@USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless
@USAirways never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed.
@USAirways sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection
@USAirways Done
@USAirways made it.. Never ran so fast in my life
@USAirways I've been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP! @AmericanAir http://t.co/jasKYPLWt5
@USAirways Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for "maintenance" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me.
@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing
@USAirways call Gate D9 in CLT and get me on this flight
@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP
@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôre automated."
@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!
@USAirways I'm logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it
@USAirways thanks for helping with #reFlight Booking Problems #Cancelled Flightedflight Yvonne Anthony.  You will help us get to Tel Aviv on time.  #HappyFriday
@USAirways big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman's desk.  Top tier customer service today.  #outstanding #service &amp; #support.
@USAirways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal.
@USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2
@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
@USAirways what is the damn delay????
@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless.
.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!
@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!
@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service
@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ‚õÑÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è
@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.
@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
@USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today.
@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard
@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else
@USAirways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We've heard it all! #LetsGo
@USAirways "Able"? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?
@USAirways 1826 trying to make a connection to Punta Cana leave PHL at 9:50
@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
@USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.
@USAirways can you help me reroute my trip?
@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo!
@USAirways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!!
@USAirways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it
@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
@USAirways @AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.
@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!
@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical.
@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service.
@USAirways Mobile boarding pass email.
@USAirways we will...sunday! Just a few days away
@USAirways I am following you now
@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes
@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
‚Äú@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?‚Äù Spring Break !!!
@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?
@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. üëå
@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice
@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to "choose" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors
@USAirways I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys‚Ä¶see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!
@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice.
@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?
@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!
@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you.
@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket.
@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta
@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection‚Ä¶ Help!
@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment.
@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??
@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!
@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home.
@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?
@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded.
@USAirways FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team!
@USAirways thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa
@USAirways We're having 2 grandbabies in 2 weeks -- will travel to DC for the births. Thank you for the reasonable fares!  See you Saturday!
@USAirways Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over!
@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
@USAirways I already HAVE, four times
@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed.
@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman
@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer
@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF
@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
@USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE.
@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
@USAirways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost
@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days.
@USAIRWAYS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ
@USAirways thanks for getting me rescheduled on a direct flight to NOLA tonight in 10 minutes--and hopefully an hour earlier getting there!
@USAirways problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways  5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight
@USAirways still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested.  Deal w this!!
@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!
@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked "completed". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded.
@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say "in progress" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th.
@USAirways @AskPayPal So I contacted my bank. They took the money out today. I also contacted @USAirways they said my reservation is
@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :)
@USAirways HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE
@USAirways thank you finally got our bag. Customer services reps were wonderful.
@USAirways Have a 6:05pm flight out of PHL Sat, 2/21. Snow expected. Are we able to switch to an earlier flight without penalty?
@USAirways we got our bags today. Thanks!
@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
@USAirways never fails to disappoint.
@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now
@USAirways flight 437 PHX&gt;ORD.  Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. :-(
@USAirways I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I‚Äôve been on flight 1776 from BOS ‚Äî&gt; PHL so many times I should have a res. seat
@USAirways http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0, vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam?
@USAirways @AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!
@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
@USAirways any word on whether or not flight 1971 from Seattle to Charlotte will have connections held? Or...
@USAirways please change direct flights from RIC to JFK instead of LGA. Pleeeeease! LGA is the pits.
@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
@USAirways Do you have a phone Nbr for Refund Dept ?
@USAirways do you post travel alerts on your website? Traveling to Bdl on Sunday morning.
@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!
@USAirways can I bring a copy or photo of my baby's birth certificate for the flight? I feel uncomfortable traveling with the real thing.
@USAirways would like to see you do similar in PHL! http://t.co/n9vGe2nPIB
@USAirways thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S
@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
@USAirways what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight?
@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
@USAirways 4420 delayed further?
@USAirways 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there.
.@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.
@USAirways 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection üò°
@USAirways just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog, any updates
@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
@USAirways - love the changes in the lounge - cheese, veggies, olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix,
@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!
@USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND
@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
@USAirways is there  anyway to get rebook in help on twitter?
@USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
@USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.
@USAirways not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I'll keep you posted
@USAirways I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport
@USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(
@USAirways wanted to connect to discuss sponsorship opportunities with http://t.co/q6Xedzvhh9, silicon valleys only 10 day film festival
@USAirways @garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more
@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone.
@USAirways US airways csr at Phoenix airport fixed the problem
@USAirways still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please
‚Äú@USAirways: @alan_bledsoe Thanks for your feedback, Alan.‚Äù Thx, but  no help as I watch a flt Lve w/open seats and I wait 3hrs for nxt flt
@usairways I don't think the US site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt). Can I use a US credit if I held on http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt?
@USAirways lol me too
@USAirways still waiting on a response
@USAirways - who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can't be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website.
@USAirways so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers
@USAirways How will I change it?
@USAirways oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat
@USAirways @AmericanAir when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better.
@USAirways a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag, why not let someone fly standby?
@USAirways thanks to the gate agent in State College, PA that was able to get me on an earlier flight AND figure out an earlier connection!
@USAirways I just think it's weird to have mileage as 666
@USAirways flight 1783 CLT to BOS
@USAirways Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can't sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed.
@USAirways but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes
@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice
@USAirways your app is bad, and you should feel bad.
@USAirways Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning.
@USAirways Is $99 companion ticket benefit of Premier World MasterCard still limited to USAirways flights or do AA now qualify as well?
@USAirways is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. @AmericanAir I hope you can fix it
@USAirways Only for one flight, though. The 2nd leg my kids are sitting scattered about the aircraft.
@USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting
@USAirways You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home.
@USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
@USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will.
@USAirways 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #BadService
@USAirways @AmericanAir been with US Airways since 03,  back and forth Gatwick - Charlotte, then LHR. Bit sad nostalgic way.
@USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.
@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
@USAirways 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people @AmericanAir exec bene's not honored
@USAirways no problem...just funny have a nice day
@USAirways yes travel is complete flight 5095 from CLT to CAK Feb 18
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled due to maintenance. The plane was there for 10 hours. Get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy.
@USAirways a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its
@USAirways was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y'all merged?
@USAirways My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with @united and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times...
@USAirways @OBJ_3 even airlines are scheming to get a follow from OBJ LMAOOO üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@USAirways No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable.
@USAirways over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter
@USAirways can you DM me &amp; add me to the upgrade list for a flt tonight?
@USAirways now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck!
@USAirways some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative
@USAirways @americanair I feel sorry for AA
@USAirways there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!!

@USAirways Stuck in Philadelphia airport for 32 hours due to "maintenance". Dreading my flight back home. Disgusting.
@USAirways I'll sincerely regret Dividend miles! Good things coming to an end :(
@USAirways thanks

@USAirways thanks for telling me my flight was on time when the plane was broken. You're an inferior airline.
@AlbertBreer just so you know who to complain to ;-) RT @USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we‚Äôll be tweeting from @AmericanAir.
@USAirways @AmericanAir for frequent flyer miles can we schedule interchangeably and get credit?
@USAirways I've called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail.  Please advise ASAP.
@USAirways they finally answered. They were rude and didn't help me at all.
@USAirways @AmericanAir no, don't leave me!!!
@USAirways #success made flight , please thank the crew of 556 great time recovery
@USAirways I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. 
http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn
@USAirways - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!
@USAirways is this accurate? Safety guide shown no MP3 player usage during takeoff and landing. http://t.co/Nvk3IrG4KP
@USAirways I've been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful
@USAirways  I have a party of 4 booked for a flight in Aug. At 10:05am, how can I find out how much it would cost to change to an earlier fl
@USAirways 1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled.
@USAirways  Lilly M in SJU check in is fabulous!
@USAirways Was just on hold with you all for TWO HOURS and then got hung up on. oh my god.
@USAirways. On phone hold for 30+ mins trying to speak to an agent. Can't change reservation online. Sigh. #badcustomerexperience
@USAirways that's where we are now. Thank you.
@USAirways I've been on a music hold for over a hour trying to get my AAdvantage membership merged, can someone please call me ASAP?
@USAirways flight was full.  1 open middle seat.  Did not want to sit there.  What is your policy?
@USAirways 657. My daughter Candice and I are together with her baby.
@USAirways sorry, I meant flight 4420, which was supposed to depart at 5:00, now says 6:30. What is the issue?
@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...
@usairways if you could change your name to @southwestair and do what they do...that'd be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings.
@USAirways #tbt every day.
@USAirways what's the issue with flight 4420 from jax being delayed tonight?
@USAirways got rebooked. Sent to A9. Wrong gate! Traveled back to B13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated
@USAirways if you've got room on an earlier flight home, why charge me $75 to get on it? Be the hero!
@USAirways @CakeNDeath Question is will he and his lady behave...
@USAirways on the DL, send Ethan some new pants and some "white revive" laundry tabs. He's a great guy, good crew, he's just, err, single.
@USAirways any updates on flight 1917 from Philly to LA?  Been sitting at gate for close to 2 hours
@USAirways will these prices be honored? Ive waited this 1 1/2 hours on hold to make sure I can still get the prices I originally started
@USAirways thank you for refunding my bag fee.  I look forward to its return today I hope.
@USAirways what's happening with 1217 Phl to LAX? Now 3 hr delay. Poor communication!
@USAirways  will be stuck in PHX overnight.  Service is getting worse.  Flying southwest from now on.
@USAirways left us. had to stay on other flight until they got bags off. This sucks. Had to run with a baby and bags!
@USAirways üòÇ. Passed frustrated 4 hours ago after being asked to get off the first plane I sat on for an hour.
@USAirways thank you
@USAirways another bad experience today.  Frozen pipes on 597.  Missing connection.
@USAirways of course! "Yeah, travel has gotten harder. Ask other passengers if they will switch" it's not the fact, it's the attitude!
@USAirways skys r sunny air is cold I can't wait to get to #CLT
@USAirways never imagined it would be so hard to SPEND money through US Air. Stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone.
@USAirways found great prices thru US Air for honeymoon. Website wont work and been on hold for more than a hour now after being told 10 min
@USAirways we on on the flight from phf to clt. At the terminal but can't get off plane yet. Need to get on iah flight.

@USAirways that's it?!?!?
@USAirways thanks for slowing the inbound plane down so that we didn't need to worry about 4438 EYW being Late Flight. Great holz ahead. Cheers! üòÄ
@USAirways they had to turn the seat cushions over and clean the area. Please explain this issue?
@USAirways My booked seat ended up being the last row which was labeled "do no occupy" had to play musical chairs for 30 mins. Unacceptable
@USAirways phone support rebooked but orig flt was Late Flight. Made it!
@USAirways KUDOS to your phone support and Charlotte gate staff!
@USAirways let's say it's directly correLate Flightd to the chance of a replacement case. I know which would cost the airline less!
@USAirways I do to as I have an afternoon Conference in Las Vegas and I would rather plan ahead than run thru the airport and then attempt
@USAirways @HirasmusBidragi will try.. Now stuck on tarmac waiting on gate. :( may miss 9:25 connection #883)

@USAirways OK she is worried that something is wrong with the flight - #1870 - and should she consider flying earlier
@USAirways [Part 2 of 2] she tried calling cust serv and the system hung up and her. Twice. Are you having system issues? Please advise.
@USAirways my wife is trying to check in for a flight tonight out of RSW...website not allowing, saying must go to airport... [Part 1 of 2]

@USAirways 'preciate it but cant get off plane to speak w agent / wont come on plane 5015 knoxville...?
@USAirways good ideas...she is traveling today...at airport.  Need to petition faa regarding silly 24 name change rule.
@USAirways res went under her maiden name...married 50...no docs with maiden name.  Hence, problem.
@USAirways just called reservations.  Cannot change just able to put note on res.  Problem is tsa...
@USAirways I'm delayed in TYS #5015, likely gonna miss my connection in CLT to CUN. Gotta get there today. Can you help me?
@USAirways plz plz plz hold 4438 to EYW. The 810 PHL &gt;CLT is sooo Late Flight. Gonna miss the connection for @jabevan221 's 40th #GTH239
@USAirways btw, not upset at usaiways, promise.
@USAirways i hate you
@USAirways it is the same passenger, just her maiden name ended up as last name through online Flight Booking Problems.  Yes, understand non transferable
@USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem
@USAirways I paid for my seat.  I expect to be able to use my full seat
@USAirways if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse?  #nothappy
@USAirways so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff
@USAirways the gate agent said "it's booked in full. Sorry" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land.
@USAirways Empty 1st class, Chairman can't move up due 2 silly award travel rule trumping common sense - customer service fail again!
@USAirways can they change to correct last name? Did via reservations already but said can't change ticket name..
@USAirways you're the only airline that's not open sooner. It's not a confidence booster.
@USAirways checked in last night @ airport by supervisor w boarding pass for 1A - boarding today seat changed to 7F. How does that happen?
@USAirways new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can't get through TSA
@USAirways cardholder is flying.  We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating.
@USAirways I received a brochure in the mail touting all the benefits of the advantage card with usa now merged...baggage included
@USAirways if I paid for ticket with advantage world executive card, do I pay baggage fees when flying us airways? Wife traveling now
@USAirways this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service
@USAirways testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am
@USAirways flying from Manchester international to Philadelphia and getting emails about delays, no information about connecting flights..
@USAirways thank you.3860 to cincy.just landed.you should add frequent flyer miles to my account..  a long, incredibly frustrating day
@USAirways no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself
@USAirways I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn't have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place #help
@USAirways Been dealing w/ @americanair to solve the probs your team created. Your Manch, NH staff is clearly your C-team, btw. #NotEvenJV
@USAirways Will do :)
@USAirways Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the @AmericanAir merger. #USAirways
@USAirways thank you. We filled out a claim and hope to have the bags tomorrow.
@USAirways I didn't Cancelled Flight my flight, you did. Than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags
@USAirways - done :)
@USAirways : i was told my ticket expired but  i never recvd any notice  before it expired .This sucks.i paid 40k miles &amp; $125 for the tckt
@USAirways captain on flight 1712 from PHX-PHL at 3:55 tonight was hilarious. "Greetings from the pointy end of the airplane" haha thanks!
@USAirways just noticed that I don't believe I saw a confirmation for a flight I bought a few weeks ago. Def paid though. #help #resend?
@USAirways worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail
@USAirways any plans to support #ApplePay on board? I have the USAirways MC and it would be nice to still use it if I forget the card.
@USAirways got through on the phone. usair Cancelled Flightled her return flights because she missed a flight on her way out. they took care of it
@USAirways I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min
@USAirways 3 delays 2 Cancelled Flightlations a double layover and 72 hours Late Flightr....could I at least get extra dividend miles?
‚Äú@USAirways: @AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM your confirmation code so we can forward your kind words.‚Äù sent
@USAirways I didn't take my original flight. I was suppose to arrive last night than by 2:00pm today. Didn't get in til 5
@USAirways sitting for 30 minutes on the runway at dca, because your gates are full? Early landing, Late Flight flight.
@USAirways #flight4592 LET US OFF THIS PLANE!!!  please go to a gate.  This is absurd.
@USAirways will I get the full amount credited to my account for US Airways credit?
@USAirways @AmericanAir 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported.
@USAirways lost our luggage. #yay
@USAirways I found a flight I want on @CheapOair. Is my @AmericanAir AA Advantage # applicable to earn miles on it since you're merging?
@USAirways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?!
@USAirways Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #SmoothOperation
@USAirways : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help
@USAirways : i have been trying to reach dividend miles  to extend my ticket for last 3 days , 20 + calls and i get a message to call back
@USAirways really!??
@USAirways how does an airline misplace an airline attendant?!! been at Reagan airport since 1pm10:15 to Cincy is delayed trying to find her
@USAirways My flight finally arrived in Charlotte.  They booked my luggage thru to lga but no room on flight for me.  What a mess
@USAirways been on hold for over an hour, still don't know where my bags are, won't refund me my flight?!?! It wasn't weather!!
@USAirways no your not!
@USAirways My wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails Is it possible usair Cancelled Flightled
@USAirways thank you for fixing my 5 hour delay.
@USAirways yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing
@USAirways this is more than having patience. This is not acceptable. http://t.co/N7pSuEJDC8
@USAirways please follow me so I can DM you about something
@usairways 4 flights in 48hrs &amp; I've had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she's great. :)
@USAirways landed safely everything worked out.
@USAirways can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline #wth
@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.
@USAirways delays to the max
@USAirways on Sunday! Can't wait! See you then
@USAirways well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA
@USAirways it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far
@USAirways attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details.  Called twice and disconnected.
@USAirways Emailed them a week ago and still nothing...
@USAirways I would be willing to pay anything to change a flight! @AllegiantTravel does not! help!
@USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE
@USAirways still waiting! Captain reports he's called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr
@USAirways is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa.
@USAirways finally rectified my flight situation! Thanks again
@USAirways so what is the  difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee?
@USAirways on time today and from PHL! Nice work! #ThereIsAFirstForEverything
@USAirways you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done
@USAirways I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX.
@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr
@USAirways being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here
@USAirways ice cream up front! Solid
@USAirways shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout
@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!
@USAirways Your software is broken. "Call Customer Support" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers.
@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
@USAirways is there nothing that can be done online to help? i bought these as a birthday present, just trying to be able to afford a change
@USAirways @AmericanAir hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit?
@USAirways delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone
@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
@USAirways I was re accommodated for my DSM flight tonight after a delay from Myrtle Beach now the flight to DSM is back on for tonight?
@USAirways so far I've gotten six different answers
@USAirways Oh certainly. And now I have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. Really happy that I was charged double.
@USAirways I got an email asking me to checkin TMRW for a flight I meant to book for 3/19 - can someone please help! @WallStSlumLord @PKG49
@USAirways what's going on? I've been hearing a not-friendly 'Please wait' on repeat while I'm on hold, being transferred to idk where...
@USAirways The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.
@USAirways I'm sorry as well. It's been 24 hrs without my bag and I can't get a straight answers. I'm on call #6 for today.
@USAirways Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.
@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
@USAirways if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn't be stuck in horrible CLT now.
@USAirways you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA
‚Äú@USAirways: @AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words.‚Äù Confirmation code?
@USAirways Finally back on board.  Door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. You think someone wd have thought of it earlier
@USAirways Secondary screenings, a piece of the plane missing... Anything you want to tell us?
@USAirways  sitting on Tarmac in #PIT for 30 min. No announcement. Just sitting.
@USAirways my TSA precheck isn't showing up on my boarding pass for my flight tomorrow...help!? #USAirways #TSAPreCheck
@USAirways I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please  pass along my feedback. I've tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :(
@USAirways Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member.
@USAirways I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.
@USAirways PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL
@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks
@USAirways the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong
@USAirways. I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good
@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool
@USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you "hope" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you.
@USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.
@USAirways just lost a faithful customer.
@USAirways  I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out
@USAirways Marsha M. at Myrtle Beach is the greatest! She deserves all the respect and praise there is! #ThankYouForEverything
@usairways. Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins.   Now flight further delayed.   Don't lite a match either http://t.co/mT8sPlm02v
@USAirways Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided.
@USAirways it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys
@USAirways well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks
@USAirways ...these changes as well to Late Flightr find out that the flight I was scheduled for isn't ready
@USAirways after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic
@USAirways that's understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate
@USAirways  thanks! Now I just need to locate where my luggage is!
@USAirways we haven't departed yet so let's not get too high hopes.  But everything has been on schedule so far
@USAirways Thanks for showing interest...3880 to Greenville, SC.
@USAirways your app sucks balls compared to @AmericanAir
@USAirways #USAirways So my flight was Late Flight getting into charlotte so i miss my connector to Phoenix thanks again last time I EVER FLY USAIR
@USAirways Thanks. Suggestion: stop the promo messages after a bit and just run music &amp; a msg that says "call volume is high." #vrm
@USAirways "admirals club" at CLT has rude, and ignorant front desk staff...@AmericanAir you have fallen so far...THANKS DOUG PARKER!!!
@USAirways to CLT from JFK nasty planes, dirty seats &amp; floors, rude flight attendants- hopefully AA can get you cleaned up #disgusting #vile
@USAirways I paid for my ticket on @PayPal on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account.
@USAirways ok thank you we were told ground delay due to snow.
@USAirways this made me have to Cancelled Flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew?
@USAirways my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday and moved to today, then while at my stop in DC my flight is delayed due to lack of crew US4485
@USAirways Looking forward to some friends and family time in Arizona.
@USAirways no they dont.  I think I already said that.  No one responds.  Its an auto response.  Wait is this an auto response??????
@USAirways @AmericanAir First Class all the way!!üí∫‚úàÔ∏è Headed to @portlandjetport http://t.co/kDMq0jps02
@USAirways started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck
@USAirways us2118
My wife in Boston says no snow right now.
@USAirways I tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we don't care
@USAirways you see now that is a lie.  They auto respond with insulting email. #sucks
@USAirways your pple did a great job w the madness however some of your systems need help. I appreciate the hard work &amp; the push to b better
@USAirways thanks for giving away my seat. Another fine job! http://t.co/r7ibqr4CYd
@USAirways @FAANews how can I be stuck on a plane due to snow in Boston when it's not actually snowing in Boston?  Usair flight 2218 #US2218
@USAirways I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.
@USAirways thanks.
@USAirways You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again...
@USAirways thanks to Betty working gate at ILM and lovely gate agents here in CLT helping me get home 2 Phx tonight instead of tomorrow
@USAirways I have a flight in Saturday from MCI to CLT and there's heavy snow predicted in MCI. When will u allow for changes?
@USAirways I realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting Cancelled Flighted. Please prioritize ur passengers and help them
@USAirways how does that help me when I get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks
@USAirways @DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard
@USAirways surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks!
@USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville
@USAirways strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst
@USAirways had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather @SouthwestAir was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again
@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease
@USAirways you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared.
@USAirways Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel &amp; I've submitted twice online
@USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!
@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
@USAirways I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight
@USAirways I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend
@USAirways I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
@USAirways Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off.
@USAirways I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport
@USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?
@USAirways so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher
@USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I'd like an answer.
@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
@USAirways that wasn‚Äôt my Q but thanks. Wondering why you‚Äôre the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uH6UwuOSC0
@USAirways turns into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn't be more unhelpful. Why
Yes but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma
@USAirways 40 minutes to put my TSA number in‚Ä¶ 40 mins‚Ä¶ and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. @tsa
@USAirways so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks
@USAirways really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks
@USAirways thanks!  Can you help remind the agents it's ok?  Ps. Heard rumors of a streaming wifi TV/movie service you might be installing
@USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain
@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone.
@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?
@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire
@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?
@USAirways a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all.
@USAirways I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's #usairwaysssuck
@USAirways the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is "I don't really know what happened"
.@USAirways thanks!
@USAirways my number is 214-725-1966.  CANT WAIT...LOL #usairsucks
@USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks
@USAirways she also appreciated having her very own hashtag! :) #lucycat
@scm1133 @USAirways we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! http://t.co/7STktJXAN1 (although we're not sure what a timbit is...)
@USAirways Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!!
@USAirways Is it possible to earn Dividend Miles for a passenger that is not me, even if I am purchasing the tickets?
@USAirways I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase.
@USAirways would you consider honoring the original fare price if I were to try Flight Booking Problems the ticket again?
@USAirways booked an award ticket recently, now same ticket is less miles. how do I contact you without using the online form or phone?
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)üôèüôèüôè‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èüôèüôèüôè
@USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
@USAirways that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again
@USAirways I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck
@USAirways I don't mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn't have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food!
@usairways That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks.
@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?
@USAirways I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway
@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options
@USAirways Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
@USAirways 
Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in 'y'?
@USAirways There isn't a ticket number...the transaction is still pending.
@USAirways do families no longer get early boarding with young kids?  American, your new parent, gives it to us...
@USAirways not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41.
@USAirways your agent did not say
@USAirways no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho
@USAirways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy?
@USAirways It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request
@USAirways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself
@USAirways that link is broken. But if it's the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information.
@USAirways Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I'm still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up
@USAirways thanks for reaching out to me.  My Gold Div no. 2k424j0. My Flights were changed under Confirmation # DNX58V.
@USAirways stranded in Philly- #Starving and can't get a meal voucher even though your plane had mechanical issue /  next flight in 10 hrs
@USAirways On hold for an hour...connected to the wrong department by your automated system...transferred and now another 45 min &amp; counting
@USAirways yes and our flight attendant (who is wonderful btw) secured the tray table so it's not flailing about. http://t.co/JhXWMuTx4G
@USAirways link doesn't work and I've tried tracking my bag several times. Still doesn't clarify where it is.
@USAirways thanks for seating me next to 2 hot athletes. This flight is significantly better now!
@USAirways Thank you!!! On our way to get her bag now - thanks to having that number üòä
@USAirways how do you give stand by seats to ticketed passengers who you know have a connecting flight ?
@USAirways Would you guys please send service agents to gate B15 in Philly?  All the people missed there connections and there's only 2.
Spend 1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways .
@USAirways why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have  a connection?
@USAirways  last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged.   No one answers the baggage call line for status?  #chairmanlove
@USAirways this is crazy. Haven't spoken to a human yet. There has to be a better way. http://t.co/mEOAlCIPdD
@usairways can I get assistance on flight #611? Plane just landed from HPN and I have a connection to ATL.
@USAirways you got me home 30 hours after you were supposed to... I was living in an airport, you offered no monetary assistance!
@USAirways I've been trying for DAYS!  And I don't get hung up on until after I get through all the prompts.  What am I to do??
@USAirways Why not have an option for a call back? I'm just sitting here burning through my minutes waiting for an error to be fixed.
@USAirways 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can't even fix it. Worst service I've ever had
@USAirways I've been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really?  A global company?  Help!
@USAirways Also, we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies.
@USAirways where's my apology?
@USAirways Thank you. But it is sad that she couldn't talk 2 a REAL person &amp; kept getting disconnected by an automated msg.
@USAirways flight today showing on time online, not able to check in. Called &amp; told was Cancelled Flightled, put on hold over an hr ago. Help?
@USAirways new tag line "but we got you there alive!"
@USAirways 2 days in a row I call and still can't get anyone on the phone. Do you actually have any employees?
@USAirways announced that people going to FL via Charlotte would have to go to a different plane &amp; gate, but it was a 'direct flight' #logic
@USAirways just realized my @AmericanAir advantage number wasn't used for my flight.  How do I get my ff miles?
@USAirways Does your company see passengers as customers or just $$$?
@USAirways Is there a way to have someone contact me when you have an agent available? Need help Flight Booking Problems an award flight.
@USAirways flight is delayed 5 hours. No reason given. Sure love flying with your airline. #whatajoke
@USAirways So we got her home, now we just need her bag. Is there a direct desk number for Savannah?
@USAirways I hope so. Last I spoke to the baggage team... they weren't sure what city my bag was in.
@USAirways Thank you, busy times.
@USAirways My flight was delayed and rerouted, and not so much as a "sorry for your inconvenience" from the check-in agent? #notimpressed
@USAirways @AmericanAir 90 min delay thanks to "maintenance issues". Thanks for wasting a day.
@USAirways 
Not one to complain much but really 1 hour 15minutes and still nothing. Agents or Agent ‚§µ http://t.co/Q5SB0DaVuy
@USAirways thanks :)
@USAirways thanks for crappy hotel with no food and a taxi bill followed by being on standby for your Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways

@USAirways any word on flight 1748 getting out of DFW in the near future? Stuck on plane at gate for over an hour
@USAirways thanks so much!
@USAirways I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight months ago I used my old license do I need to change that?
@USAirways No, this is a systemic problem. Mail comes from 153.69.214.203 but USAirways SPF record disallows it. DM me for more detail
@USAirways little help to us! My husband has been on hold for an hour for something that take 5 minutes to complete.
@USAirways I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight a months ago I used my old license do I need to change that?

@USAirways my vacation budget was blown bc of the lack of communication from USAirways. I will never use them again or refer anyone!
@USAirways Credit to my bank account for the two days of work that I've missed because of these Cancelled Flightlations.
@USAirways I don't need to rebook I need to know the policy
@USAirways No reFlight Booking Problems necessary. I can't afford to deal this kind of unprofessionalism again. I would, however, like some type of credit.
@USAirways what are the odds you can get me on a flight with delta so I can actually get to Orlando today?? #2daysLate Flight

@USAirways that is the most useless tweet I've ever seen out of you.
@USAirways this is got to be the worst service I've ever seen with an airline. 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. Currently flight delayed
@USAirways so you're going to make me wait that long on the phone line when you can help me? # that's part of the problem
@USAirways now over 2 hrs. Can't wait anymore. 2 hrs for nothing. Now what?? #frustrated #USAirways http://t.co/BuwjTVUWKM

@USAirways lack of communication with other offices, the customer, &amp; yall never update ur systems. U guys are 2 established 4 this mess

@USAirways hi!  Could you protect me on US 445 just in case? Still on ground with no checked luggage, but still a chance I can make original
@USAirways great but that still does not help me..
@USAirways @Forsyth_Factor hope for no weather delays no help to reroute and your on your own for lodging non stop is the way to go
@USAirways why didn't you reroute BOS to JAX via DCA through CLT instead forcing an overnight @DCA #passengersLose
@USAirways I appreciate the hard work. Still, I gave up after &gt;hour. @dsearls
@USAirways my luggage was delayed. I'm looking for compensation, since, you know, you charged me for it then forgot it...

@USAirways disappointment? Making own arrangements for me &amp; my sleeping toddler with zero assistance from USAir is maddening.
@USAirways thank you
@USAirways thanks. We did see an agent. Unhelpful. Some got vouchers others did not for unexplained reasons.
@USAirways 25 mins after the scheduled departure and still sitting in terminal. Communication would be lovely... http://t.co/pkAxUNYfn2
@USAirways this day has been a disaster, rude employees, no help &amp; now no hotel. not flying with you again &amp; I fly ALOT! Dallas=raise=now!
@usairways traveling with 2 year old. would appreciate you holding up your end of good business and hosting us in our unanticipated layover.
@usairways missed flight connection due to flight attendant delay. Yet no voucher on your part? #fail
@USAirways of course never again tho . Thanks for tweetin ur concern but not Doin anythin to fix what happened. I'll choose wiser next time
@USAirways I absolutely knew you would try to blame weather to deny us vouchers in Phoenix. Totally false, was a crew issue.
@USAirways half an inch of snow in Charlotte #overwhelming
@USAirways on the phone now. looks like global
@USAirways Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number.
@USAirways already called, no other options, flight is being reimbursed. Never again, you are unreliable for business travelers.
@USAirways your saving grace was our flight attendant Dallas who was amazing. wish he would transfer to Delta where I would see him again
@USAirways that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding.
@USAirways My flight (US558) got Cancelled Flightled on 2/16 due to lack of flight crew.I was told that I'd be reimbursed for hotel. Who do I contact?
@USAirways No need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . There is no up date, I've landed but was suppose to land at 5
@USAirways ~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. Promises doesn't make up for it
@USAirways my sister was supposed to leave at 10 am to go back to AL. She's only getting to NC now. Are you kidding me #NeverflyUSairways üëø
@USAirways she just did but really how drunk does someone have to be before you stop serving them
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST AIRWAYS!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)üôèüôèüôè‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èüôèüôèüôè
@USAirways 5 hr flight delay and a delay when we land . Is that even real life ? Get me off this plane , I wanna go home üë†üë†üë† (3 heel clicks)
@USAirways flt 4439 is on the ground, but you don't have a gate for us at dca. Why is this happening?
@USAirways Shout out to the red-headed gate agent for flt 3389 from DCA to CHS at 7:10 tonight. Didn't get her name but she was great!
@USAirways I'm sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether
@USAirways Now, the JFK Baggage Office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour
@USAirways Dude named Shaquille at the desk in Charlotte was incredibly professional and helpful vs. some crazy angry people tonight
@USAirways  really u gave 6 scotch on the rocks to an out of control drunk and would not let my sister change seats when he was grouping her
@USAirways Awesome USAir, TYSVM &lt;3
@USAirways Thank you!
@USAirways  that would be lovely! You have great people working in your organization.
@USAirways Only the JFK baggage office is open to help re-book all of us on Cancelled Flightled flight 3121 to DCA. Shameful.
@USAirways hey let flight 1874get to the gate  hours Late Flight and no fate with dozens of kids on board
@USAirways me too. Me too.
@USAirways a flight update doesn't help when we are waiting 20+ min at our arrival waiting for a plane to leave our gate. Who can I write?üòë
@USAirways TYVM USAir, Happy Night@ &lt;3
@USAirways thanks! It's hectic for everyone but their actions don't represent the company well IMO
@USAirways @husainhaqqani Mr. Husain u shld protest as well when one of ur party member Rehman Malik delayed a PIA flight for hours..???
@USAirways NOT GOOD. been on hold for 1hour (2x/day) since sun. to book 1-way flt dividend miles. agents send me to on hold hell. #furious
@USAirways I'm sure you don't but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won't come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. Tks.
@USAirways not too impressed with your airlines but I would feel a lot better flying with if you upgraded me up to first class tomorrow
@USAirways  glad to be home and that your great people got me home safely. Sad for others who didn't get back bc of scheduling problems.
@USAirways how about an update? 2hrs delayed, this obviously isnt up 2 date, havent boarded http://t.co/L7lWjaZiOA
@USAirways @noltnancy What will be is a what may be...what is...sucks. #fail
@USAirways Your whole handling of this was a joke.Boston Logan had one little old lady,ONE handling all the customers http://t.co/DH2rfUIJYP
@USAirways Will do. I appreciate the response.
@USAirways @erickofiejones how long are billing cycles
@USAirways on hold for 1:23. All because they won't let me use a companion voucher online http://t.co/DPhQRgkdoA
@USAirways and no one has been at all helpful. I will never fly this airline again. #NeverAgain #spreadtheword
@USAirways No, they won't because after 5 hours of holding I had to give up because I couldn't borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours...
@USAirways I've been sitting in the Charlotte airport for 4 hours. Waited for crew and now maintenance.  #NeverAgain
@USAirways delayed my flight 3 times before Cancelled Flighting it, had angry and rude workers, and are now providing no helpful service at all
@USAirways My daughter is stranded in charlotte because US Airways Cancelled Flightled her flight tonight.  Completely dissatisfied with @USAirways
@usairways Thanks to Kevin and team at F38ish at PHL for some great service recovery tonight. Appreciate it.
@USAirways Commitment to excellence is 2b praised. Can get you to the wrong city 2 days Late Flight or the right one 3 days Late Flight. #customerservice
@USAirways car services to and from the hotel, food, hotel cost bc of Cancelled Flightlations fall on the customer with last minute notifications
@USAirways I'm amazed at the lack of communication with the passengers.
@USAirways when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn't care less
@USAirways beware,  Barklays bank has terrible cust service. Will not assist, only know to go by badly written book(in English).
@USAirways they call weather an act of God and refuse to help. I have my wife and 3 kids and they have no sympathy.
@USAirways bad weather shouldn't mean bad service
@USAirways stuck in Charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff.
@USAirways flights keep getting delayed and Cancelled Flighted with no information, worst customer service ever.
@USAirways what does "your reservation is 'out of sync.'" mean? On hold w customer service 12 min and want an idea what is up
@USAirways sits on a throne of lies
@USAirways where's my bag?  You called at noon promising it today, would like an update like your website promises.  I need that bag!
@USAirways flt 470 Tampa to CLT is very Late Flight gonna miss conn to BOS what can you do?
@USAirways I'm on the flight, finally in the air. Not enough food to feed customers. No movie or entertainment on a 5 hr flight.
@USAirways I just hope that pilot had a good day off
@USAirways thanks for your help! I left a message for DCA lost and found. Fingers crossed we find it!
@USAirways is the worst airline I‚Äôve ever flown on. You guys have treated me like garbage today.
@USAirways Only water on flight 763 to DCA? This is the first time I've ever seen this happen. #ExecutivePlatinumMeansNothing #IWantCoffee
@USAirways Eh, it happens. I think I'll survive. üòâ Thanks!
@USAirways I have a voucher from a past trip that was delayed. I thought I had to talk to someone on the phone to use it. Is that not true?
@USAirways I did, but it won't help.. Can't believe you wouldn't take full fare for first class and gave away to Platinum Member.. Profits?
@USAirways 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous!
@USAirways - I'm in the Cust Svc line.  Your Charlotte, NC agents better be in their A game.
@USAirways and if the flight is full?
@USAirways been delayed three times now finally boarded. Been waiting 20 minutes. Now being told the plan has to be completely powered down.
@USAirways 4 hours... 4 hours... FOUR HOURS.  It's like this is a joke to you.
thanks to @USAirways my trip is all screwed up. Ive had to move meetings and a dinner and im STILL not out of nyc yet
@USAirways i dont need to check status of my flight because i was ON the plane and you had a door malfunction. Get it together!!
@USAirways freaking out about the fact you are fixing the engine from Charlotte to Orlando. #longday
@USAirways I was told there is no record of my refund.  Can someone please help me. This has been a long day
@USAirways I tried speaking to multiple people at your reservations desk after 30 min on hold. #waivethefee #poorcustomerservice #Neptune
@USAirways Being put back on hold for what has now been an HOUR is completely unacceptable.
@USAirways Stop reposting same autoresponse  That was return flight home #imateacher. Couldnt get to RSW  #neptune#waivethefee #notmyfault
@USAirways contd.. They put her on 7 pm flite tonite. I think she's on now. Worst customer service ever! U need to fix it.

@USAirways HA!  You're fun.
@USAirways UR service is so shitty. Pilot never showed up so we waited hours because another pilot was supposed to come but didn't #Cancelled Flighted
@USAirways how long is that flight? http://t.co/bCwckWtnlE
@USAirways flying high thanks!
@USAirways ticket couldnt be used bc unable to get to departing dest (RSW) bc of blizzard in BOS. Told only way to use credit is $200 fine
@USAirways if I cant get through to reservations how can they take a look? 2+ hour hold times are not reasonable in any industry!
@USAirways 3+ hours on hold... oh, wait, for less than 5 minutes a useless CSR talked to me and put me back on hold for the last 30 minutes.
@USAirways Thanks. It would be better from the gate agent at C14 in Charlotte boarding flight 1791.
@USAirways flt 5302 CLT to DAY supposed to depart 5:51; the 6:20...still no crew. #schedule/contact the pilot!
@USAirways so i ask for ice and the attendant snaps "i dont have ice on this cart" not 5 min Late Flightr 2 cups of ice to the people 2 rows ahead.
@USAirways thanks
@USAirways I've been waiting for the callback for EIGHT HOURS. HOW MUCH LONGER?!
@USAirways 2 and a half hours on hold... Hope it feels good to be a steaming pile of shit.  @AmericanAir paid far too much for you.
@USAirways  redeemed themselves!  Flight out at 7:44!!! Had to call and negotiate,  but thank the Lord I'm heading home!!!!!
@USAirways Total BS... I offered to pay for a full First Class airfare ..Told Sold out.. 3 seats and they gave the seats to others... #crap
@USAirways I been on hold with U for 40mins wasting my time and $ &amp; I don't appreciate it #WheresTheCustomerServiceAt http://t.co/phI2IfNjIT
@USAirways It was US 893. The gate was open after about 50 mins waiting. What a great way to finish an 18 hour delayed arrival!!
@USAirways strikes again. @emilylyonss  I strongly suggest you live tweet your ordeal. Their media team appreciates the updates üòé
@USAirways flight 4524  first a 2 hour wait for a deadhead crew  then deadhead crew takes overhead bin space paying customers annoyed
@USAirways with the weather mess in the South, I missed my connection in CLT. Impressed though with the Cust Serv phone reps today.
@USAirways And really, it's a middle initial versus middle name. All else the same. Not spending my time on your computer issues.
@USAirways very disappointed I wasn't "allowed" to change seats after checking in early online for a flight tomorrow morning.
@USAirways They're all reservations numbers and none are in Hungary. And my phone not working here. You make it too difficult.
@USAirways 8 weeks to refund this ticket - 0372389047497?!? - totally unacceptable.  Fix this or I'll put it on blast on social media and TV
@USAirways yes I can pay out of pocket that us not helping me for loosing my first class ticket to coach.   I want resolution or a comp
@USAirways Frustrating days!No flights home, changed airlines. Thank you PHL USAirway employees &amp; @united for help getting me back to IAH.
@USAirways @satesq theres only one flt PHL-CRW per day.
@USAirways @AmericanAir Your staff members are looking at me like I have two heads. Check your own websites!!! http://t.co/8Hh0c63TIe

@USAirways flight #654 sitting at JFK with delays for 3-1/2 hrs! No employees to load bags? #terrible
@USAirways I have been rebooked but It has been handled very unprofessionally. Cancelled Flightations happen but the disorganization is uncalled for.
@USAirways conf number FMJTYL delayed - any chance of getting an earlier flight fll to phx?
@USAirways I have now called 12 times in the last three days. That's unacceptable. I'm willing to wait on hold, but that's not an option.

@USAirways I've been on hold for over 2 hours. Need to re-book a flight, please help.
@usairways It was 9¬∫, and some of us had left coats in our luggage in anticipation of cramped overhead bins :|
@USAirways I'm traveling around the world until the end of the year. 800 numbers do me no good.
@USAirways I don't know I've tried to call for confirmation but calls aren't going thru. Can you let me know?
@USAirways can I get free wifi since the flight 1808 was Cancelled Flightled?
@USAirways was rebooked but sucked big time. Crappy layover. Customer service very sub-par.
@USAirways Sending thanks to employee Freddie in PHL Admiral Club A East for allowing me to give a day pass to my sibling stuck there today.
@USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw.
@USAirways holding 30+ min and listening to your shitty ads on repeat for your credit make me hate your airline even more.  @delta is better
@USAirways I would be on my way but   wether has delayed yet again.. Love the Charlotte ice storm!!  Good luck with mad customers
@USAirways Please staff your flights approproately. Our entire flight is delayed because FA isnt here. I shouldnt have left Delta...
@USAirways tooooo many Cancelled Flightations! My chain of command hates me now
@USAirways  you Cancelled Flightled both my flights and refused to give a voucher despite no flights for 2days. @USAirways #neveragain
@USAirways I just think if I am staying w your airline &amp; rescheduling a flight I shouldn't absorb a fee that is the cost of 1/2 my flight
@USAirways that's why u guys are my #1 choice.
@USAirways thanks. üòí
@usairways I‚Äôm cool with weather delays etc. But lying and deceiving passengers to keep them from changing is reprehensible. #yousuck
@usairways I just want to get home before Wednesday... Joke is over, 50hrs of Cancelled Flightlations and delays is enough!
@USAirways how about a drink voucher for the next flight?? #winkwink
@USAirways nice touch with using my first name.  Very intimate.  I'll be filing a claim soon to be reimbursed. Have a us airways day!
@USAirways The airline is embarrassing itself. I get that bad weather isn't your fault, but your response to it couldn't have been worse.
@USAirways any updates on flight 5202 from ORF to PHL no one at gate...  ;(
@usairways Yes. Works in Firefox. 

Can do everything but finish purchase. Button turns gray, never submits. For a couple weeks now.
@USAirways 2.5 hours Late Flightr and the flight has been Cancelled Flightled. You gotta work on your internal communication skills.
@USAirways had a horrible experience flying from Montego Bay to Philadelphia on 2/11. $125 2check a golf bag, constant selling in-flight
@usairways told no gates open at #ORD, needed to wait 20mins. Still waiting after about 4 mins.
@USAirways And it's 3:22 with no sign of boarding.... Can I please get another update?
@USAirways still can't get a real person on the phone to book a flight. Ready to just go with #jetblue since they care. #usairwayssucks
@USAirways after missing my flight and reFlight Booking Problems 2x, I just walked onto another flight and my phone was still on the seat!!
@USAirways great job communicating to the passengers! Flight 1855 doesn't exist anymore? http://t.co/hLZaHXkdSn
@USAirways thanks Travis at PHL A East checkin for knowing baggage policies. Skis &amp; boots count as 1. Teach your mgr who didn't know
@usairways Thx for responding :) When bags came there was mad rush towards end of jetway‚Äîwhy not just put thru baggage claim?
@USAirways @AmericanAir  we are on us/aa flight 4443.We  arrived at dca at 2:12. Waiting on our gate (33)for apx an hr now. No update?
@USAirways  Have an agent with reservations contact me instead of asking me to waste my time by sitting on the phone for hours
@USAirways If you believe in keeping your customers happy, especially after a mistake was made on your part...
@USAirways Would love to combine AA and USAir accts. Unfortunately, one has my middle name &amp; one has middle initial. Won't allow change
@USAirways I had a rep 10 min in who said she couldn't help so transferred me to dividend miles customer service
@USAirways right on. Up. Up &amp; away ‚úàÔ∏èüåû
@USAirways your customer service stinks. Trying to book a flight for hours now and keep getting hung up on. #usairwayssucks
@USAirways please please please let my plane back to the gate so I can get off as I will miss connection due to CLT closing. 2034
@USAirways we've (flight 4443) been sitting on the tarmac of dca for a while now waiting on a gate. Can we just use another gate?
@USAirways I hope flight 1855 is not being delayed because flight attendant didn't come to work! #nobackup
@usairways you made us miss our flight, first class now I can't even enter the admirals club.  Not happy  dm me to fix this.
@USAirways can you please DM me, my flight has been delayed going into CLT which will force me to miss my connection to LGA at 10:05pm
@USAirways on hold for 2 hours. You know what just keep my money
@USAirways charging $200 2 change a flight is a rip off the reason I have 2 is out of my hands &amp; I want 2 reschedule same flight but in July
@USAirways flight 1808 is not leaving at 2:45 because we haven't even begun to board yet. Please update your website ASAP
@USAirways @Jack_Kairys (2/2) and another sent him to the wrong line...oh and the kiosks weren't working! #thanks
@USAirways also your employees were LESS then helpful when @Jack_Kairys was checking his bag. Two just left their desks completely (1/2)
@USAirways the phone number the gate gave me doesn't work either. What is your customer service phone number?
@USAirways done
@USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense?
@USAirways never in my life have I dealt with such poor customer service, irresponsible staff and lack of care LGA-IAH day 2, baggage in NC?
@USAirways Thks 4 tip. Seems like a workaround rather than a customer-friendly solution. They should have an easily accessible email.
@USAirways unfortunately not. I think I watched it take off from the bus. Rebooked for a Late Flightr flight now #planestrainsandautomobiles
@USAirways I was supposed to be on flight 1861 from Charlotte to RDU @ 8:20pm yesterday. Is the same flight scheduled for departure tonight?
@USAirways Thank you so much its been a very stressful day
@USAirways me too. In the future, have a better harsh weather preparedness plan. So much of your staff called out that everything snowballed
@usairways If I could/wanted to call I wouldn't use the internet to make a reservation.

Site won't work on Chrome, on several computers.
@USAirways Darn it, first in line for no upgrade! Wish I understood the policy. :) http://t.co/xGPaAyFDwt
@USAirways Waiting for my luggage on flight 1923. Is there a delay?

@USAirways Flight Booking Problems a flight using credit from a previously Cancelled Flightled flight. Can't get thru on the phone and can't book online. Help please.
@USAirways Absolutely!! The staff was amazing!!
@USAirways you are horrendous.  Pull your shit together
@USAirways Haha - that will indeed be a great day!
@USAirways I want my money back. Now we're sitting on the runway. After a 2 hour delay, waiting for the baggage to begin loading.
@USAirways how is your gate agent gonna tell me my flight is on time when its 5 minutes past departure time and the previous flights plane..
@USAirways this is the aforementioned pilot. @AmericanAir sure you want to merge with these patron hitting hoodlums? http://t.co/C24cEfa9pl
@USAirways  my flight was #3729...but I left my phone on the plane or the shuttle :(
@USAirways thank you! I tried that and they said they didn't have it. Anywhere else to try?
@USAirways @AmericanAir  best u could do-I might get my refund within 2 billing cycles. Months of u guys asking for another chance. I'm done
@usairways and @AmericanAir  4 days of Cancelled Flightations, I have driven to 3 airports in 3 different states, spent more on gas than my flight.
@USAirways then why did my whole team be able to put there carry ons under the plane
@USAirways customer service at its finest
@USAirways No speciifc email. 1500 character limit for complaints. Is AA/US customer complaints adopting the twitter model?
@USAirways please hold 3923! I can see it. Just can't get off my first plane quick enough
@USAirways please hogs my next flight for me! I'm waiting on a bus to get me off one plane so I can run to the other. It leaves in two min!
@USAirways Fabulous - thank you so much! Looking forward to taking to the skies with you! :)
.@USAirways we r rebooked. got conflicting info abt baggage. Y no extra plane batteries on hand? Y no comped admirals club for 9 hr wait?
@USAirways Don't tell me that. Tell me what I can actually DO to reach someone. I don't mind being put on hold but it won't even do THAT.
@USAirways No I missed the funeral so I had to take a train back to Newark
@USAirways what is the baggage allowance on flights from Glasgow to the US?  Thanks
@USAirways @AmericanAir what a joke of a company today reminded me why I never book with you

@USAirways it's be nice to take a flight and have some level of consistency / service from the flight attendants. Quality control???
@USAirways Travelling from pwm to atl on Sunday That flight got Cancelled Flightled and my new flight is Cancelled Flightled and got disconnected when reFlight Booking Problems

@USAirways I was completely ripped of by US Airways today never fly this airline  I am contacting my local news
@USAirways I can't believe that you would refer me to a number no one seems to be getting through. Really? I need help ASAP!
@USAirways hundreds of people in line and less than half the desks being manned at CLT. Help?
@USAirways Why is there no contact email for customer complaints?
@USAirways Now I am probably going to miss my connection in Charlotte, so I will have to drive home for the funeral.
@USAirways Flight 2069 from JFK to Charlotte, then 3750 from Charlotte to Birmingham. 2 previous flights to HSV were Cancelled Flightled.
@USAirways still crickets from customer service.
@USAirways flight #3900 fro ORF to PHL.
@USAirways 
That is not an excuse to have such a poor website Flight Booking Problems options! My yearly vacation is about to fall through, ubetter do smth!
@USAirways The phone line disconnects. How can I be in the queue to be answered when the phone line simply disconnects when I call?
@USAirways want to bump up my seet to first class for two Cancelled Flightlations in 24hrs?? what a joke
@USAirways  to arrive the plane I'm sitting on needs to take off...wish someone would tell us what the holdup is
@USAirways This is dating back to Nov. I have been sent back and forth between you and @eDreams_en. It's a disgrace.
@USAirways will do. Hoping for a voucher for a future flight #Optimistic
@USAirways I didn't even leave the airport and you sent 2 of my bags to Philadelphia!
@USAirways Thanks for the info but have been trying for over 24hrs and no luck. Flight dep. Today. Need 2 change 2 tomorrow or Thursday
@USAirways tried twice today on hold for 30 min each time. i have things to do so can't live on hold dealing w/ your customer serv failures
@USAirways no warm weather hubs means no Mexico for us.  And I can't go anywhere else since you lost my bags. I hope you attempt to rectify
@USAirways No kidding. Oy.
@USAirways thanks
@USAirways thank you for blowing my vacation. Couldn't get me anywhere today to make my reservation and also lost 2 bags of mine!
@USAirways been trying to talk with a dividend miles rep for 2 days now. I have been holding for over 2 hours each day. What are my options?
@USAirways and it still says it's on time on your website btw
@USAirways your customer service is horrible
@USAirways I expect something more than telling me to see an agent to rebook my flight...
@USAirways you have the ability to switch my flight to @AmericanAir but you cannot tell me where my bags are.
@USAirways I did and it's been a disaster. You had me sitting on the runway only to bring the plane back to the gate smh
@USAirways no we haven't because we've been in the same line at the service desk for an 1hr and 1/2 now in the same spot.
@USAirways on your website and on your boards at Logan it said it was on time, so we went through security and got to the gate (2)
@USAirways I got up at 2 am for a 5 am flight from bos to Charlotte which I found was Cancelled Flightled once I got to the gate (1)
@USAirways please give Tara G a pat on the back and praise.  She was very very helpful.  She is at PHL member lounge
@USAirways  thanks I hope I get to my destination
@USAirways  well its 11:45am and just got an email that my 11am flight is delayed-thats not right
@USAirways How soon is possible? I boarded the plane the 1st time at 6:30 am and it is now after 11:30 am and I'm still where I started.
@USAirways your chairmans phone is down. what other number can i use?
@USAirways @AmericanAir you make Spirit look like the gem of air travel. You haven't handle this winter storm very well...
@USAirways thanks for the reply, hoping everything is cleared up in Charlotte by Monday
@USAirways it takes a month?
Yes, I filed a report in Atlanta. My bags are in Charlotte, NC. 24 hours Late Flightr and still can't find my luggage ... @USAirways
@USAirways it was supposed to be a carry on and in Pittsburgh  coming to Boston it was a carry on
@USAirways You need to contact me ASAP. #Furious
@USAirways can't even get on hold to wait to speak to someone-awesome
@USAirways Almost 4 hours and coin now. Understand higher call volume, but this is unacceptable.
. @USAirways It's been Cancelled Flighted. Your SM response is slow.
@USAirways I‚Äôve had my flight Cancelled Flightled twice now, and after 5 minutes of automated questions, the phone just goes to a busy signal. Help?
@USAirways great job today In ruining 45 people's vacation. Thanks to your incompetent pilot and staff we have all now missed our flights
@USAirways your service has been awful in Boston and I had to pay 25 extra dollars than I was supposed too I am very dissatisfied #mad
@USAirways we are on the 2pm flight FLL to PHL and then connection to MAN. However, with the delays we might miss it. Can we go earlier?
@USAirways I have been on hold with your Gold reservations line for OVER 3 HOURS now. Flight Cancelled Flightled. Trying to rebook.
.@USAirways we have no choice but to pay another $50 to go to the airport in the hopes that we will be treated better by a rep.
@USAirways reservations had me on hold for 2 hours only to hang up...smh üòï
@USAirways @AmericanAir How r u supposed to change flights when u can't get thru to reservations? #OneHourOnHold
@USAirways how's us 1797 looking today?
@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@AmericanAir we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal
@AmericanAir no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible.
@AmericanAir sorry so Late Flight, responded to your DM.
@AmericanAir Believe me, I understand. Flight #2955. Was originally booked for Sunday. Flight was Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled for today.
@AmericanAir aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10,000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers
@AmericanAir Mold on my flight?!? US3825 #filthyplane #hopeidonotgetsick http://t.co/zIK2UoXGnW
@AmericanAir 767 seconds from touchdown at Madrid airport in April 2013 #AvGeek http://t.co/1yWXRfn0Gr
@AmericanAir I slept in the miami airport due to mechanical issues and was given 10,000 bonus miles to try and make it right. #slapintheface
@AmericanAir is the new 9:45 time confirmed or it may get Cancelled Flightled? Traveling with kids, need to be certain. Thx
@AmericanAir 1hr 46 min. Cost of flight change $788. Was $188 2hrs ago b/f drop call. Cancelled Flighted flight. Asked 4 refund.
@AmericanAir it's not just frustrating--it was PAID for! how do we get a refund?
@AmericanAir DM the locator code, thanks.
@AmericanAir thank you!
@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest
@americanair thanks for no fresh food on my cross country flight and for making my connection so close No time to eat. TPA-DFW-LAX
@AmericanAir my flight got Cancelled Flightled from GRK to DFW, then to LEX for tomorrow and I need it rebooked.
@AmericanAir Do you have any sort of live chat feature? We're in the UK right now and that call would cost us alot. :(
@AmericanAir your planes made me miss 2 connections in 2 days. Thanks for nothing
@AmericanAir I purchased Main Cabin XT for f-1571AUS. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and I was rescheduled on 1600 with regular seats. Credit?

@AmericanAir r u serious?? 304min #delay with #AmericanAirlines #AA2444 #ohio - #dallas missed my connecting flight http://t.co/DNMsblzumr
@AmericanAir You are jumping the gun and Cancelled Flighting flights that could've made it before the snow. Now, more Cancelled Flightlations. It's ridiculous.
@AmericanAir I might look into that. My wife travels much more than I do. Could we both use the membership?
@AmericanAir Thank you, you too!

@AmericanAir Great, thanks. Followed.
@AmericanAir This is exactly why ill be flying AA from @Dulles_Airport to Dallas! Only airline I trust!

@AmericanAir if by near the gate you mean sitting on the plane for almost 2 hours, then yeah.
@AmericanAir I don't think you should help him at all based on his behavior. The voucher and cot seem like enough lol üòÉ
@AmericanAir still waiting for a flight... I should get my money back
@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flighted my flight. I really don‚Äôt need this much trouble.
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @Andrew_Wasila We're sorry you were uncomfortable, Andrew. What can we do for you?‚Äù SMA
@AmericanAir Hi, can you please ticket my award ticket? The status is "On Request" now. Thanks.
@AmericanAir got back eventually! Was a rollercoaster. Once I got to the airport &amp; got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick.
@AmericanAir that's 16+ extra hours of travel time. Missed vacation time and now you guys are messing with my professional life.
@AmericanAir Checked in on app since yesterday. Confirmed upgrade &amp; carry on, got to counter &amp; manager upgraded somebody else on my seat!
@AmericanAir Trying desperately to get my boyfriend booked on the same US Airways flight as myself for the same price. Can you help?

@AmericanAir i ordered it as i always do. But on a 9hour flight delayed for 4 hours, it was worse than ever before when you forgot my meal.
@AmericanAir thanks so much!
@AmericanAir @RobertDwyer AA doesnt charge any fees to change award tickets as long as the origin, destination &amp; award type remains the same
@AmericanAir I need a flight out tonight. Isn't there anything else?
@AmericanAir thank you for the confirmation.
@AmericanAir spent $8 for the choppiest feed of "Whiplash" ever. #americanairlinesfail #iwantmymoneyback
@AmericanAir OK I will call them likely tmrw UK time to question the process getting the change charge reversed due to a bereavement
@AmericanAir - Please find my bag!! In Singapore for three days already without my bag. Last known destination LAX Tag: 580815 Please help.
@AmericanAir ‚ÄúInconvenient‚Äù is such a convenient word.
@AmericanAir
 Your response could have made all the difference. It could have made the situation better. NO TRUST...GET LOST like my bag.
@AmericanAir delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to New York, this is disgraceful
@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this.
@AmericanAir come on I just want to go home I can't miss another day of work #stuckinmemphis #texasisclosed
@AmericanAir Here is the photo ;) http://t.co/VMqUURZUpW
@AmericanAir you guys are killing me. http://t.co/22iPGeIcSm
@AmericanAir Aww cool! It's nice to know they are still up above my head then. One of my faves.
@AmericanAir what's the status of flight 1357 out of sju?
@AmericanAir Would love to DM you, but my Twitter app says you're not following me and I can't.
@AmericanAir Its not that I wasn't offered "perks" by @USAirways.  I ASKED and was told, "NO." #thenewamerican
@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir cost me over 200 dollars because flight was Cancelled Flightled and couldn't even give me a food comp!! Fly @JetBlue @Delta they take
@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
@americanair Yes to the iOS. I'm running iOS 8.1.3
@AmericanAir worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you're delayed
@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh.
@AmericanAir - keeping AA up in the Air! My crew chief cousin Alex Espinosa in DFW! http://t.co/0HXLNvZknP
@AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You'll never touch my pets again.
@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
@AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
@AmericanAir 
It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA.
@AmericanAir I am looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned.
@AmericanAir @Clarkey_19 we done it with 1 truck... No biggie üòÑ
@AmericanAir and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven't been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams
@AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
@AmericanAir flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today!
@AmericanAir "Airport snow removal method #22..."
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/oUmC1LrXDN
@AmericanAir These birds could fly to South America for example #Argentina
@AmericanAir my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight?
@AmericanAir great, thanks!
@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
@AmericanAir flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice
@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy.
@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don‚Äôt accept the change it won‚Äôt let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?
@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff
@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems.
@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@AmericanAir thanks!
@AmericanAir Aww Thanks AA..DFW was on GMA up here this AM..so i understand ..Btw A.A is my Airline when im able to trv..Love you guys.:)
@AmericanAir These are some awesome photos. Thanks for sharing! üòÅ
@americanair new plane, #gogo, easy power for laptop, iPhone, just missing a good boat-style swivel cup holder for my #dietcoke #happyflier
@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
@AmericanAir You Cancelled Flight my flight and there‚Äôs no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc @Delta
@AmericanAir I thought all those planes were retired? #MD80
Just got off the phone @AmericanAir customer service. Only 8 minutes to get my issue resoled. You guys are awesome.
@AmericanAir thanks for the info Is there a number I can call to speak to a person? It's going to take an hour to type it out
@AmericanAir we are off to Kax premium.  Hoping this flight is better food, TV now I know how to work it and service. Tnx
@AmericanAir @beantownmatty Sounds like a date!
@AmericanAir I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, "NO."
@AmericanAir Flight 35. I'm on my way.
@AmericanAir car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait
@AmericanAir Thanks so much!
‚Äú@AmericanAir: We hope you enjoy the #WinterWeather and brought your warm coat and gloves, Maria!‚Äù Yup! New beanie http://t.co/AnEqXZR4bp
@AmericanAir @lpalumbo what weather sun is out
@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
@AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight.
@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
@AmericanAir 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir
@AmericanAir my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me?
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0
@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
@AmericanAir @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!
@AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!
@AmericanAir how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really sad feeling to be ignored.
@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
@AmericanAir I want to speak to a human being! !!  This is not an obscene request!
@AmericanAir no response to DM or email yet.  customer service?
@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
@AmericanAir Thank you.....you do the same!!
@AmericanAir you need to work harder on the disconnect between your intention and the reality your passengers face
@AmericanAir - how long does it take to get credit to my AA account? Traveled in Jan &amp; only one leg reported. Asked for credit, no response.
@AmericanAir Hopefully you ll see bad ones as opportunity to get better and not dwell in it... and the good ones as encouragement words!
@AmericanAir Okay, I think 1565 has waited long enough for a gate at DFW...
@DeltaAssist now at 57 minutes waiting on Silver Elite line for someone to pick up! Help!
@DeltaAssist what I have to say is more than 140 characters! Plus you don't follow me
@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@AmericanAir we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.

@AmericanAir Would love to DM you, but my Twitter app says you're not following me and I can't.
@AmericanAir Its not that I wasn't offered "perks" by @USAirways.  I ASKED and was told, "NO." #thenewamerican
@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir cost me over 200 dollars because flight was Cancelled Flightled and couldn't even give me a food comp!! Fly @JetBlue @Delta they take
@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
@americanair Yes to the iOS. I'm running iOS 8.1.3
@AmericanAir worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you're delayed
@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh.
@AmericanAir - keeping AA up in the Air! My crew chief cousin Alex Espinosa in DFW! http://t.co/0HXLNvZknP
@AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You'll never touch my pets again.
@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
@AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
@AmericanAir 
It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA.
@AmericanAir I am looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned.
@AmericanAir @Clarkey_19 we done it with 1 truck... No biggie üòÑ
@AmericanAir and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven't been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams
@AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
@AmericanAir flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today!
@AmericanAir "Airport snow removal method #22..."
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/oUmC1LrXDN
@AmericanAir These birds could fly to South America for example #Argentina
@AmericanAir my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight?
@AmericanAir great, thanks!
@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
@AmericanAir flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice
@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy.
@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don‚Äôt accept the change it won‚Äôt let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?
@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff
@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems.
@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@AmericanAir thanks!
@AmericanAir Aww Thanks AA..DFW was on GMA up here this AM..so i understand ..Btw A.A is my Airline when im able to trv..Love you guys.:)
@AmericanAir These are some awesome photos. Thanks for sharing! üòÅ
@americanair new plane, #gogo, easy power for laptop, iPhone, just missing a good boat-style swivel cup holder for my #dietcoke #happyflier
@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
@AmericanAir You Cancelled Flight my flight and there‚Äôs no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc @Delta
@AmericanAir I thought all those planes were retired? #MD80
Just got off the phone @AmericanAir customer service. Only 8 minutes to get my issue resoled. You guys are awesome.
@AmericanAir thanks for the info Is there a number I can call to speak to a person? It's going to take an hour to type it out
@AmericanAir we are off to Kax premium.  Hoping this flight is better food, TV now I know how to work it and service. Tnx
@AmericanAir @beantownmatty Sounds like a date!
@AmericanAir I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, "NO."
@AmericanAir Flight 35. I'm on my way.
@AmericanAir car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait
@AmericanAir Thanks so much!
‚Äú@AmericanAir: We hope you enjoy the #WinterWeather and brought your warm coat and gloves, Maria!‚Äù Yup! New beanie http://t.co/AnEqXZR4bp
@AmericanAir @lpalumbo what weather sun is out
@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
@AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight.
@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
@AmericanAir 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir
@AmericanAir my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me?
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0
@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
@AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical
@AmericanAir Nice to read it! Thank you very much!
@AmericanAir we have been advised to turn this issue over to the police due to the sexual assult THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT ON YOUR PLANE!
@AmericanAir Fuck you.
@AmericanAir 
Not giving you a hard time...Just looking for basic customer service after AA lost my bag. ETA on it's return, please????????
@AmericanAir I bet they do! I'm sure they have some form of wear and tear on their skin. I hope they will survive the rest of the winter xxx
@AmericanAir @dfwairport me too!!  LOVE LIVING SO CLOSE SO I ALWAYS HAVE GREAT VIEWS!
@AmericanAir Thanks!
@americanair Can someone contact me about my awful experience with american airlines this weekend
@AmericanAir actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase
@AmericanAir your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest.
@AmericanAir @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!
@AmericanAir @dfwairport Guys, let it go. http://t.co/vOxcghciJi
@AmericanAir Is there a way to add my AA number to an itinerary that doesn't involve sitting on hold for 1.5 hours?
@AmericanAir I can hardly believe it! Bundle up and stay warm! üòâ
@AmericanAir You're right. Someone is up to something...
@AmericanAir the flight is not going to make the connection to #MEX #AA2444
@AmericanAir Thanks for sharing these photos! Round of applause for your crews! We appreciate all their hard work.
@AmericanAir can I get a free ticket to Hawaii for being fabulous
@AmericanAir 1-the lavatory freezes, 2- problem with a nitrogen line 3-a low tire with the inflating equipment malfunctioning #AA2444 and...
@AmericanAir i want to change my flight for next week, they will still charge me. Waiting for fligt status
@AmericanAir @dfwairport That's DFW!? OMG! Yeah cold, everywhere!
@AmericanAir great customer service thanks
@AmericanAir When Flight Booking Problems an int'l flight online, do I have to provide a passport number when Flight Booking Problems or just when I arrive at airport?
@AmericanAir yes they do http://t.co/wCSAZZQPae
@AmericanAir hook me up with a free trip to Barbados and I will tell you the secret beaches to see
@AmericanAir why did flight 1636 get Cancelled Flightled? Waiting for a rep to rebook, but wondering if there will be other issues getting out.
@AmericanAir  we are going to the police dept due to the sexual assult that your stewardess allowed to occur and your lack of concern
@AmericanAir Thank you for responding so quickly to my tweets I do appreciate that.
@AmericanAir I am trying to change the time of a flight I already purchased and was told I have to pay a $400 change fee. Ridiculous.
@AmericanAir please email me at temorris2010@hotmail.com. willing to discuss my experience &amp; give another try would like to speak directly
@AmericanAir if my flight gets Cancelled Flightled i should be able to reschedule to any date i want, not the next day or 2 days after
@AmericanAir since you don't care about what happens to your passengers on your planes we will now be contacting the Police Dept
@AmericanAir why are @USAirways gold forced to pay for an upgrade? Open seats in 1st and not offered to Gold/Sapphire
‚Äú@AmericanAir: Bet these birds wish they'd flown south for the #winter... http://t.co/tY9C0Gae2o‚Äù Lol
@AmericanAir 
I still think American Airlines is great...I would just like to be treated better. Loyal customers first, right?
@AmericanAir if I could fly an md80/dc10 I would be so happy I live that plane so much md80 is love md80 is life.
@ods1819 aren't you glad this isn't you RT @AmericanAir: Bet these birds wish they'd flown south for the #winter... http://t.co/HEpkNpuzwU
@AmericanAir second pic from CDG?
@AmericanAir I'm sure all these birds will be in warmer weather soon.
@AmericanAir It's been 3 weeks and no reply from customer relations yet.  Running out of time, please help.  request: 1-2888155964    thanks
@AmericanAir This is very true. Another reason why we stay South in the Winter months of travel http://t.co/fgJbex480D
@AmericanAir Would have had to fly real far south, huh? #WinterWeather #Brrr
@AmericanAir um. down south has snow too #ATL
@AmericanAir I'm sure they did. It's certainly chilly back East today! üòÆ
@AmericanAir Any reason why my 1463 flight to Chicago is boarding and I still don't have a seat assignment? Seriously?
@AmericanAir @USAirways if this is how your merger is going to go, you fail! Huge probls w/comm on DFW storm. Cxld rtrn flts. NOT COOL!!!
@AmericanAir why does it feel like I'm being nickeled and dime to enjoy a flight with AA? I purchased a tkt but have to pay extra for a seat
@AmericanAir Flight 2559 it's been delayed every hour since 8:55 am.
@AmericanAir do you still use DC9's?
Happy #TT to my friends @AmericanAir . Hope the weather isn't causing you too many headaches.
@AmericanAir if I've booked an AA award on USAir metal, and space opens up on AA metal, can I change to the AA flight without fees?
@AmericanAir well have all day and all the time in the world
@AmericanAir Can't unload flight #3322 because jetway is broken.  #steps #planB? #waiting nearly an hour
@AmericanAir I'd love to take my seat, but it appears as though someone already has.  #disappointed #upgrademe #wtf http://t.co/9Gx5mMmubb
@AmericanAir if i want to change my flight due to weather conditions in Dallas this weekend, i should be able to cover change fee with miles
@AmericanAir Are you expecting delays/Cancelled Flightlations at Dallas on 25/26th due to the snow? Nothing like Monday I hope!
@AmericanAir just look at RDU airport. please think about the safety of your passengers. we cant get to RDU safely!

http://t.co/wDyEkVB1Ze
@AmericanAir Please explain why it costs almost the same price of a full roundtrip fair to only change the departure time of a flight?
@AmericanAir The flight was delayed 5 times. Spent almost 40min on the tarmac. I'll reconsider my future flight options.
@AmericanAir oh it's nothing my issue was already resolved and I am in the air
@AmericanAir Filled out a baggage claim over the phone last night. Check the status to discover the rep confused Arkansas for Alaska üòí
@AmericanAir I need an answer why we can't get into Wichita Falls.
@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines says most bags left in Miami have been returned following mechanical glitch &gt;&gt; http://t.co/Ib8kyjBCJM
@AmericanAir I need refund.
@AmericanAir really needs to get a a clue and start treating people like humans, not animals.  #americandairlinesSUCKS
@AmericanAir why is raleigh not on the updated southern states advisory???
@AmericanAir hi we have lost and found solution we want to offer for free to assist with contacting people when items are found
@AmericanAir and it's not a inconvenience it is a disaster. It's A $500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay
@AmericanAir have your experts seen this? this is right at RDU airport. http://t.co/mPliO6DYgn
@AmericanAir stop sending me back to "customer relations "I have hand written a letter to them, send in a letter, called them, no help!!
@AmericanAir Is large Wichita Falls Airport not receiving any arrivals? I have called and no one answers. I been waiting for 1 day
@AmericanAir 
Can you tell me what that means? I work and just need an estimated time of arrival please? I need my laptop for work. Thanks
@AmericanAir Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW?
@AmericanAir Kudos to the captain and crew for handling fustrated people while dealing with the preventable issues and shortcomings by maint
@AmericanAir do you offer group pricing discounts by any chance?
@AmericanAir now I understand!!
@AmericanAir Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate w/companies forU!
@AmericanAir I guess that is your way of saying thanks for sharing but I can't help you, Good Luck. Happy Birthday to me. Ugh
@AmericanAir Lots of upset people, freezing terminal, and no gate agent. Kept us waiting on plane beyond allowable time length.
@AmericanAir The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks.
@AmericanAir fly my child
@AmericanAir Yes I am. 2495/1170. RNO departure at 1229 on 2/25 w/connection at DFW to LGA. I can do the 1120am to LAX and then to JFK
@AmericanAir How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation?
@AmericanAir Lost and Found is like talking to a hormonal teenager who refuses to talk to you. #useless #wastedeffort #FAIL
@AmericanAir Oh they seem  to have reappeared now lol
@AmericanAir and then wanted to change it to BA for Avios.
@AmericanAir Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats
@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO.
@AmericanAir Thanks for the quick response - it's appreciated!
@AmericanAir 
Thank you for responding...My laptop is in my bag and I need it for work. I am worried. The file code is UTEVGW.
@AmericanAir guess that's what I get for bragging on you. I fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they don't have other options JS
@AmericanAir thanks for the update
@AmericanAir thanks for finally letting me get through to book my flight. Frustration  set in... #donedeal #talktoahuman
@AmericanAir I guess I was one of the select few that hadn't had many problems before this and all the sudden my whole trip got jacked
Yes, and it gets disconnected due to the lack of WIFI strength ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @MauererPower Have you reached out to @Gogo for help, David?‚Äù
@AmericanAir the communications seems to be an issue too, no?
@AmericanAir Hi guys.I have 2/25 RNO-DFW tomorrow.Plane coming from DFW with bad weather in AM.should I consider F√™-route as I have connect?
@AmericanAir Traveling with my infant: Do you check the carseat for free? If so, do you provide a bag? Someone told me but wanted to confirm
@AmericanAir now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another???
@AmericanAir DM me and I can explain the whole story. I should have been on an earlier flight not US1937
@AmericanAir Lets hope it stays that way.Big thanks to your ground/outside crews all across the US the last month. Great FB post yesterday.
@AmericanAir 
Hello...My baggage has been lost in another city. Can anyone help me with this?
@AmericanAir my boss is :)
@AmericanAir sitting on plane in Columbus, supposed to leave an hour ago. Now the mechanic can't find a tool to service the shock absorber.
@AmericanAir Not here yet, but I plan on it. If you could have them fly low and slow right in front of me, that would be great. ;-)
@AmericanAir forgot to select my ksml on my flight to LA and it's a few minutes under the 24 hour mark. Is there any way to change it?
@AmericanAir I picked the nonstop flight bc I had things to get to. Should‚Äôve taken diff route or airline I suppose!
@AmericanAir Your response has been incredible. Truly amazed at the steps you have taken to enhance your customer relations. Big thank you üòÑ
@AmericanAir I'll DM you.
@AmericanAir Yes, talked to them. FLL says is at central. Central says is at FLL and here we go again. I'm betting this will go 6 mths
@AmericanAir but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle
@AmericanAir Is there lack of communication/competition between the American and the Air by any chance?
@AmericanAir I can DM it to you, if you follow me
@AmericanAir No, had already waited an hour for it and wanted to get home.
@AmericanAir 4285. Apparently we‚Äôre told, staff on the ground keep promising to come and they don‚Äôt.
@AmericanAir over 70 days  no contact from a human or apology letter. @AmericanAir is #yucki. Read all about it soon http://t.co/9R9OmzQAVI
@AmericanAir Well I'm showing I am still sitting at the gate on the plane that has not departed?
@AmericanAir Thanks guys got some sleep. Hang in there DFW with bad weather.
@AmericanAir My ticket was booked with AA with miles..... Sorry we sold you a ticket with a company we merged with but we can't fix it?
@AmericanAir Is it possible to change the FF number on a passenger on a Flight Booking Problems, it won't let me change it?
@AmericanAir great thank you
@AmericanAir..still here. feet are freezing b/c doors have been open. Flt time was 8:30.  We have fuel but now waiting for "rampers" #AA4285
@AmericanAir Just got a call from baggage dept. "...still looking for your property". It's went missing 1/28. PRERECORDED NO HUMAN SERVICE!!
@AmericanAir help http://t.co/hYrAo7A4Uu
@AmericanAir there is a fat man stuck in your airplanes bathroom
@AmericanAir Connection is US2065
@AmericanAir I am dealing with the reFlight Booking Problems agent in the Miami airport now
@AmericanAir simply amazing. Smiles for miles.Thank u for my upgrade tomorrow for ORD.We are spending a lot of time together next few weeks!
@AmericanAir what's the status of flight 3494 XNA to DFW. I'm getting different reports?
@AmericanAir Thank you for the quick customer service today. #RefundProcedureNotTooPainful I know that Winter Weather is not your fault.
@AmericanAir I need to go to YYZ tmr morning 8am. I switched to United already, but my bag is still off in AA la-la land.
@AmericanAir drop me a follow I need help
@AmericanAir the whole plane is the same. How old is this plane?  The seats leather is coming apart ay the seams.
@AmericanAir yes I do I am traveling to Marsh Harbor
@AmericanAir @cityandsand we're trying to coordinate an airport hand-off of Nutella! #veryimportantproject
@AmericanAir If the flight I selected online was what was ticketed I would not be missing my connection. I need help getting to DFW or IAH!!
@AmericanAir my seat is disgusting. Old and dirty. When are you going to refurbish this plane?  US Air 597 jfk to phx
@AmericanAir is there any way to manually add gift cards to an ex-EU ticket( AA metal on long haul,BA for intra-EU)?
@AmericanAir I understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on...
@AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance?
@AmericanAir no repair made to the water line. No potable water on board this flight. "We will take off soon." Time for new planes MCI&gt;DFW.
@AmericanAir thanks for the recommendation. We've been sitting here for 45 minutes, last update was 35 min ago.
@AmericanAir I'll be sticking with @southwest in the future. No change fees, first bag free, and stellar customer service.
@AmericanAir does it show that we are on the same plane?
@AmericanAir although you have no control of the weather, you came through with a great customer service
@AmericanAir there is no local agent! There is no person to answer our questions and their phone service is terrible.
@AmericanAir ...2/2 doesn't help me.
@AmericanAir As I already have a booked flight that I can't use &amp; can't change w/o a $200 fee, Flight Booking Problems a different type of ticket...1/2
@AmericanAir depends on the terminal, what' the best option? Arrive C, depart A. Breakfast burrito is what I'm craving.. Any update on 1119?
@AmericanAir an overzealous stewardess prevented us from bringing in a car seat! #worstflight!
@AmericanAir watch out if you are a parent...they break stroller &amp; tell you look at the fine print
@AmericanAir I wish I could remember all of their names!
@AmericanAir and is there a delay on our connection to pns?
@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. how frequently are these weather advisories updated throughout the day?
@AmericanAir living in DFW.. Your Hub.. Hate having to fly to JFK to get to Ireland
@AmericanAir ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn't leaving till 1220
@AmericanAir thank you AA, this is how I always start my vacations http://t.co/dzKc3auZU9
@AmericanAir how do I talk to an actual person that will help me, and do what you guys should do?
@AmericanAir Customer service provides no wiggle room to change flight without a $200 change fee. @southwest has always been accommodating.
@AmericanAir flight AA1119, cx to AA157. Killing my layover, still wanting breakfast. I'm hungry! Get me to DFW!
@AmericanAir Yes, thank you. Just not how I wanted to start my vacation!
@AmericanAir my flight number is 3M 50
@AmericanAir your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. We can not get any information about our flight.
@AmericanAir when the pilot announces that the plane has been unused for 2 days and maintenance is dealing with another aircraft..
@AmericanAir I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? üôè
@AmericanAir thank you for replying. Trying to figure out how to get from there from DFW
@AmericanAir don't merge with an airline that ain't ready for prime time and book your elite flyers on it! #NotHappy @USAirways #NeedCoffee
@AmericanAir @USAirways Yes, obviously! It just stinks that 4pm is the one option when she was supposed to fly at 7AM YESTERDAY.
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @Dumas2TTG Good morning, Tamara. We'll try to get you comfortably on a flight as soon as we can.‚Äù#NoXTraLegRoom #NoCoatCloset
@AmericanAir made it!  Thanks AA!
@AmericanAir how do you NOT do maintenance on #MD80 while it sits for two days? Frozen lines found after its boarded? Come on! #faail #mci
@AmericanAir why thank you!! Yayayay!!
@AmericanAir That what I hoped - contacted them 3 wks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in US funds. #frustrated
@AmericanAir we're all being told by emergency services to stay home for the next 24-48 hours.
@AmericanAir Thank you for being so responsive on Twitter. Truly impressive.
@AmericanAir flight BA1551 departing tomorrow (wednesday) - not Cancelled Flightled but how can anyone make it to the airport in this weather?
@AmericanAir @USAirways She's on Manch to Charlotte Fl 4628 Told her she could get on a 4pm flight to West Palm Beach. Nothing earlier?
@AmericanAir @USAirways #Boo! Wack ass terminal 6 @flyLAXairport. No food. No lounge. No Bueno!! Never again!!!
@AmericanAir it's flight 5348
@AmericanAir You sent me a cheque today which can‚Äôt be paid into a UK bank account. VERY annoying!
@AmericanAir The Wichita Falls Airport is the worst, will never fly in or out again.  Unknowledgeable staff.
@AmericanAir please can you tell me why DFW has a weather advisory and RDU does not? the entire state of NC has shut down from ice &amp; snow!
Thank you, @AmericanAir! Much appreciated.
I'd like the 11c I originally tried for @AmericanAir - again, happy to pay the difference
@AmericanAir when will you be issuing a weather advisory for RDU?? the entire state of NC has shut down from the overnight winter storm.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to?
@AmericanAir mission accomplished today, Thank you!
@AmericanAir  zoom in on the sauce and potatoes.  This stuff is vile.  And I mean vile. http://t.co/m2PHoavRxC
@AmericanAir when will the merging of miles between you and @USAirways be complete? Wasn't it this month?
@AmericanAir - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. Today. Worst on the planet. And I've flown almost all of them
@AmericanAir when will there be wifi on the DCA-STL route?  2 hour flight, could use some love!
@AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
@AmericanAir  thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. Will never book again with your airline. Train your flight attendants better.
@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
@AmericanAir thanks for the great customer service. Family made it back to SAT safely. The weather at DFW made things a little worrisome.
@AmericanAir She seems a little preoccupied - that's why I'm bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer.
@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside.
@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts "why this person was talking to her".
@AmericanAir yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU
@AmericanAir Your AA3465 staff are refusing to allow a woman to board. She was here at 8 for 8:16 departure. Sign still "Now Boarding"...
@AmericanAir fantastic thanks! Will try and tweet a photo of the view :)
@AmericanAir excellent!  Love you guys!  If it is first class I'll hug ya'll!  See you shortly!
@AmericanAir Thanks, have emailed them. How long should I expect for a response?
@AmericanAir  They said it works 80-90% of the time, DFW security entrance C26. Before/after pre-check, whereas I paid for the service.
@AmericanAir 3659 from SGF -&gt; DFW. You might want to clear off the ice for the planes landing. üò≥
@AmericanAir great job TYR ground crew...now let's get this bird outta here!!!  Tell flight 3200 to wait on me...be there in 45 mikes!
@AmericanAir @USAirways stated before I'm not getting any help there. Tk over 8 hrs yest to spk to a live person then told to chk the site.
@americanair One question.. my wife didn't get the bonus. Should I call about it today?
@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform.
@AmericanAir Good morning!  Wondering why my pre-TSA check was not on my boarding pass this morning??
@AmericanAir  Yes I do bit you don't follow me so I can't DM you
@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.
@AmericanAir again, no special meal catered for me in F JFK-LAX. thankfully i'm on qantas the rest of way-i fear what youd NOT cater on that
@AmericanAir @superyan I did not get any compensation after Cancelled Flighting my departure TWICE and made me missed my own wedding.
@AmericanAir 140 characters aren't enough to describe how inconsiderate your employees are
@AmericanAir was hoping for 8A if possible, for some frozen views along the way!
@AmericanAir ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up :)
@AmericanAir your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time.
@AmericanAir really? That's it? Not even a "we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time"
@AmericanAir Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401
@AmericanAir Thank you.
@AmericanAir She told us we had to drive back to drop it off so they could attempt to fix it. Really? Don't have time to do that. #terrible
@AmericanAir hi when will your next set of flights be out for next year from Dublin???
@AmericanAir. Had my flight changed from US Airways to you, now I can't get two seats together. Can you help?
@AmericanAir The flight is the wrong day. Confirm # USXLON. Departure on 5/21 should be 5/22 for 2 people
@AmericanAir having trouble Flight Booking Problems a seat on US84 11 March, operated by AA. Neither airline's website will allow seat selection?
@AmericanAir thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance.
@AmericanAir I fly weekly with you and haven't seen one
@AmericanAir I would love to say the same but it's not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll
@AmericanAir Uwon't allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service?
@AmericanAir oh I will, AA on speed dial
Thanks, @chasefoster. Was just about to book a flight to UK using @AmericanAir, but after reading this exchange, there's no way. I've sent
@AmericanAir Amazing to watch @chasefoster (who travels with celebs all over the world) show the youth of America who *not* to fly with.
@AmericanAir travel week, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, "if you want to learn more about the merger press 1", delay my connector in Chicago #deice
@AmericanAir Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction.
@AmericanAir Horrible service @loganairports. Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn't help at all.
@AmericanAir That‚Äôs a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesn‚Äôt understand e-mail 101.
@AmericanAir thanks! Flight 2160 today. Great crew!
@AmericanAir "Thank you for contacting American. The email address you have written to is an unmonitored account‚Äù
@AmericanAir Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful?
@AmericanAir If you are sorry, answer my claims (AA Ref#1-2990176298, 1-3001885409 and : 1-3001885409) accordingly, without using "weather"
@AmericanAir the motor that usually starts the engine is broke and @CVGairport ground crew failed to do it on time, per pilot #maintenance
@AmericanAir is rising like the sun at DCA this morning.  @NATCA members have the best view. #avgeek http://t.co/VAhdekVOKe
@AmericanAir she has  the guy u served drinks 2  til he needed awheelchair to get off the plane is a more important then the assaulted women
@AmericanAir there's a lot of talks and no doing.

@AmericanAir and @CVGairport get it together, perfect combination for delays and Cancelled Flightlations
@AmericanAir Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future !
@AmericanAir Thank you for the info! Changes need to be made over the phone, correct? Is there any way an AA agent can call me directly?
@AmericanAir are you a bot? Haha always same lies from you!
@AmericanAir especially during a death in the family and still no solution. 96 hours and counting...Thanks
@AmericanAir fortunately the window seat was a no-show. Able to scoot over and create space.
@AmericanAir so great AA1103 sitting for an hour first technical problems now what?
@AmericanAir this has to be the absolute WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!
@AmericanAir so I have to call back at 9 since the department is closed. This has to be the biggest bunch of bull!
@AmericanAir just need to know why it wasn't done like it was promised it would yesterday
@AmericanAir too Late Flight now. Boarded, exit rows taken. Could not have gotten worse. Guy next 2 me should've bought 2 seats. #miserablemorning
@AmericanAir did that yesterday. On the phone with them now
@AmericanAir re-staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you.
@AmericanAir @USAirways Statement wasn't sent yesterday like Jeanine said. After I even called last night as well. Again, excellent service
@AmericanAir @USAirways So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges?
@AmericanAir 3 months of straight travel ahead. Time to find new airline.
@AmericanAir that's what is on my ticket and my confirmation email. Anything else?
@AmericanAir I'm flying into DCA my bag is at IAD.  I am already Late Flight for my meetings at work.  I will call the number when I land üò≠
@AmericanAir try this. DPDFPP
@AmericanAir face palm!!! Cannot believe the last 24 hrs 1.5 hrs of sleep and No and no and what you can't do......
@AmericanAir just wow Regina just told me I can't file or request a lost bag statement until I finish my travel.  So until I get to DC argg
@AmericanAir I shared my experience several times (AA Ref#1-2990176298), but AA's response is senseless, weather was not the cause!!!
@AmericanAir record number is BPDFPP.
@AmericanAir You should be apologizing for your rude sales reps and failure to offer anything other than trite, condescending platitudes....

@AmericanAir LAX-OGG-LAX using hard earned miles and was given lousy service, faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. Your customer care
@AmericanAir they were no where to be found at Midnight Last Night! I would think the agent in LAX could have relayed that info.Bag on flt
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy
@AmericanAir is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a $350 bag and not replace and shrug the damage off? Flights from...
@AmericanAir it isn't good enough. You need to provide a phone number. Other partners do. Should be investigated by @IATA @TheFAAOnline
Lol great answer.. ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @JayFranceschi Our agents are checking in passengers as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience.‚Äù

http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
@AmericanAir Ps, I was right.
@AmericanAir yes it is in Dulles and I need it delivered to the Embassy Suites in Herndon, VA. I'm still in Chicago from the fiasco in LAX
@AmericanAir what's the point? So I can wait for another 6 weeks. U r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone
@AmericanAir machines are broken, lines are out the door for self service, cust. Support, and bag check in.
@AmericanAir would have been had I seen this before 1130pm EST, when I was sound asleep.
@AmericanAir merged airlines do not work for FF programs. Very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #AttitudeIssues
@AmericanAir You don't have those abilities anywhere! Not at the ticket counter, at cust service, or online. That's why we're done here.
@AmericanAir when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not?
@AmericanAir needs to get their shit together. 2 counter people &amp; a massive line. People need to catch their flights! http://t.co/4MQFMxeBXt
@AmericanAir I know your policy. Just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances.
@AmericanAir the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing.  Just wow
@AmericanAir  oh no she left the counter and went downstairs.  Then she told Elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter.
@AmericanAir Of course you are because that's your companies job! You guys failed at it in the first place. Upgrade me and then we'll talk.
@AmericanAir @Delta Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead.
@AmericanAir you really need some customer service training for your unhappy EEs in the morning in Chicago. Gate K20 at 430 chking her schd
.@AmericanAir (2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue.

.@AmericanAir Alright prove it: (1/3) 3 days ago, I sat on a plane at JFK for 3 hrs, deplaned for 3 more, and when I re-boarded...
@AmericanAir I'm trying to choose my seats but every time I go to the next flight I get system error
@AmericanAir Thanks, both airlines said that it is located at AA Detroit. Also was informed that it flew with AA, which shouldn't matter.
@AmericanAir We did talk with Delta for about hour over phone, and I got a number from Delta that they asked to give to AA, which I did.
@AmericanAir Policy makers need to change their mindset on aviation. Flying is not for... http://t.co/DQnn0Rf1V8
@AmericanAir already did- reply was "sorry. we believe this to be fair." as a journalist writing an article on my trip i will include this
@AmericanAir leave us stranded, send baggage with important medication to different city for 4days&amp;apologise with a $50 voucher. appalling.
@AmericanAir I've been trying to change a Thursday flight and there's a ridiculous wait time on the phone, and your website isn't helping
@AmericanAir @Slacksoft_uk I saw an American 767 in old colours at @HeathrowAirport on Saturday! Was surprised to see!
@AmericanAir We all did! Skipper's walk-around too :(
@AmericanAir Plane Veers Off Runway at Icy Dallas Airport http://t.co/DW6VDvqXBB
@AmericanAir Thank you for the acknowledgement. The IFE didn't work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system.
@AmericanAir thanks for the canned reply.
@AmericanAir just went to check into flight 24 hr advance, again husband and I are seated separately for 6hr flight! why does this happen??
@AmericanAir no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information
@AmericanAir or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled!
@AmericanAir I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there.  I've emailed your customer service twice now who don't seem to care.
@AmericanAir no I've since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost!
@AmericanAir nothing, you have done enough.
@AmericanAir I was rebooked on a flight that was too Late Flight for my connection!
@AmericanAir Such a suprise! New vanity kit set for frequent travellers üòÄ thank you AA! http://t.co/fA7Nygn1Ux
@AmericanAir gah this is so frustrating! Nobody has my address here in the USA. Where are my bags!?!? So disorganised!!!!!!!!!!!
@AmericanAir lovely flight back from MIA to LHR - great crew - thanks :-))
@AmericanAir I have emailed several times.hand wrote a letter,went to airport,called.please fix this! Or @abc7newsBayArea please help!
@AmericanAir offered me a cot to sleep on?After they Cancelled Flightled my flight. A fucking cot. What about a hotel, like you're supposed to provide
@AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
@AmericanAir another generic response guys? Cmon. You're terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX
@AmericanAir I tried, EXTREMELY RUDE. Even the supervisor. And when I asked to speak to HIS supervisor I was told no
@AmericanAir yes but you are still human I hope, dealing with all the horror stories people share... I complained to DOT. Everyone should
@AmericanAir try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere
@AmericanAir I have filed multiple complaints. I prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp.
@AmericanAir worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation
@AmericanAir terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over 5 days total #angrycustomer
@AmericanAir WORST SERVICE EVER!! Delayed flights for more than 5 hours plus you missed my bag! And your employees are rude üò°üò°
@AmericanAir thanks for the generic computer generated response. How about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry
@AmericanAir they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel rooms...that is terrible..
@AmericanAir I did twice.got a letter back saying that your company "doesn't issue refunds for phone bills" help!phone will be shut off
@AmericanAir oh, yeah. I guess those are two different things. 3 am does weird things to my brain. Thanks again! xox
@AmericanAir yes. No one is answering and I'm on a train
@AmericanAir TY! But, their site says " Please note that we do not offer a print subscription service for American Way. ..."
@AmericanAir its not weather thats why i said the other people received hotel rooms while the people at the end of the line did not get them
@AmericanAir just hoping/praying for a safe flight. They've had to stop and de-ice our plane yet againüòû
@AmericanAir after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 to"arrange pick up"in argentina,claiming tollfree: won't reimburse me. Help!
@AmericanAir pity that a machine replied, or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine.
@AmericanAir i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is, why do some people get hotel and the others don't like myself?
@AmericanAir I responded. Your info different than your customer service line
@AmericanAir done
@AmericanAir will not help us on the phone, at the gate or in checkin. I book travel for clients and cannot believe the lack of service
@AmericanAir no no no, YOU DM me, I pay you money and you want to me to reach out to you for help? How about the other way around
@AmericanAir I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain
@AmericanAir does not know the meaning of customer service. Nightmare. Paid for direct flight. Bumped to Dallas. Flight Cancelled Flighted. Terrible
@AmericanAir that's absolutely horrible customer service. The person supposed to call me can't immediately call back when disconnected???
@AmericanAir will do. I also passed the website around to other passengers.
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled I called they said they'd call back in 1:36. They did And hung up now saying I have to wait 2 hrs!!
@AmericanAir *does = doesn't
@AmericanAir Okay... If someone does it look for it now my fear is it will be lost forever. It's a very small item.
@AmericanAir what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service!
@AmericanAir @emxlyy "The wheel was broken when we got it. We swear."
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled flight from fresno then rebooked for LAX now flight Cancelled Flightled again and its midnight with no more hotel available???
@AmericanAir I'll give a reward for whoever finds and returns to me on Thurs when I fly back thru @dfwairport. I ‚ù§Ô∏è these earrings!!
@AmericanAir checked in at Des Moines, lay over in ORD, final destination Austin, Texas.  Baggage was only checked to ORD.
@AmericanAir and btwn gate a8 &amp; a15 I lost a diamond earring #dayjustgotWORSE! Pls have maintenance look for it!! http://t.co/UieSR3GHHO
@AmericanAir we then had to deplane, and change planes.
@AmericanAir you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight for today and booked me for tomorrow, so unfortunately i have rebooked. Thanks
@AmericanAir after running from one flight, because we had 10 mins, to our next flight, we then sat on our plane for an hour.
@AmericanAir but your flight crews &amp; ground crews have handled situation well. Texting notification let me catch a few winks during delay.
@AmericanAir Thx! I hope so. IAH to DFW to OKC has turned out to be a LONG trip today and I have to work tomorrow.
@AmericanAir I understand that but I'm hoping I can rectify this in advance. I would call but I am in AUH. I just need my one checked bag.
@AmericanAir yeah, buy me a @Delta plane ticket from San Diego to Detroit so I can fly one of their planes home tomorrow
@AmericanAir nothing to do with Mother Nature, more like poor commutation.
@AmericanAir is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be.
@AmericanAir hey! I have a name issue on my reservation can you help?
@AmericanAir I DM'd you
@AmericanAir thank you! My lost item was located at ORD and is being returned to me.
Why doesn't @AmericanAir provide a means for dialogue?  What is the fear that drives this decision?  #worstcustomerserviceever
@AmericanAir 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event
@AmericanAir please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.
@AmericanAir it's not only my bag...it's the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag
@AmericanAir If SNA curfew causes diversion, do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now, pilot not sure if we have time.
Why doesn't @AmericanAir allow for conversations between upset customers and their customer service?  #worstcustomerserviceever
@AmericanAir  it's not cool that my flight was Cancelled Flightled after sitting on the plane for over an hour. üëéüò°‚úàÔ∏è #notahappycustomer #leavingtomm
@AmericanAir no, you should do something about everything happened yesterday...
@AmericanAir  and I forgot about that lounge!üòÇ
@AmericanAir Thanks! Bleh, disconnected! Let's try this again!!
@AmericanAir appreciate it!!
@AmericanAir I love the Admiral Clubs! Thanks, hey can you follow me?
@AmericanAir - Reference number to this request: 1-3001408092
@AmericanAir just curious. Thanks for the response as always, good or bad. Better than your competition.
@AmericanAir  your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage.
@AmericanAir were stuck on a plane in Dallas that's supposed to be going to Okc. There's an issue w/ the plane. Any idea on how much longer?
@AmericanAir - thanks. She submitted a damaged bag complaint online...is there anything else we can do? #goodcustomerservice
@AmericanAir Thanks!
@AmericanAir they responded. I can't respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever
@AmericanAir thanks  you always be my airline of choice when possible
@AmericanAir gate agents disappeared and customer service agents were miserable and unhelpful. #letdown #neveragain
@AmericanAir Who do I report missing baggage to when baggage claim leaves before midnight?
.@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I'd rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks!
@AmericanAir TSA. When I tried to check in the things I've bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back
@AmericanAir arrived +-10pm eastern. Had to deplane on the CRJs airstairs to an icy Tarmac. Valet bags sent to carousel, so it was 10:20pm.
@AmericanAir attended to and corrected my complaints via Twitter. Whoa. This is the brave, new world we live in. Thank you, American Air :)
@AmericanAir couldn't get anyone on the phone all day, the flight you rebooked had me missing a conference.We won't be on flt 1568 tomorrow.

@AmericanAir It's sad how I can't afford any long distance trips though. :/
@AmericanAir btw you guys should consider making a lounge at Austin Intl. airport! Very popuLate Flightd area! Will help the company for sureüëå
@djevolutionhd As an EP who travels 125K+ miles a yr with @AmericanAir , I would expect more from them than this horrible travel experience
@AmericanAir Are you expecting any delays out of #DFW tomorrow morning?
@AmericanAir that was the worst customer service experience ever. Too bad for you I'm a lawyer. Enjoy my wrath.
@AmericanAir it's beyond complicated now and it feels like when I used to fly with United. Platinum means nothing.
@AmericanAir I look forward to hearing back and hope that my next trip will not be like this
@AmericanAir Oh trust me. I am in love. It is so beautiful!
@AmericanAir followed!  Sure hope you can help!
@AmericanAir @BoeingAirplanes I really would love to experience first class on that plane,looks stunning!
@AmericanAir I love the service and cheap upgrades American Provides! One of the best airlines ever! good food, good seats, amazing thanks!
@AmericanAir - you broke my sick wife's luggage handle going from JFK to LAX...she had to drag her bag thru the airport! #customerservice
@AmericanAir @gerri_elliott You will!! Every chance I get! Thanks for keeping me Exec Platinum.
@AmericanAir no not yet. Waiting now to be connected to an agent
@AmericanAir when should i expect a response from customer relations
@AmericanAir no not yet. Waiting to be connected to an agent
@AmericanAir glad that you WANTED to help me, but you didn't. Have an agent call me before I rant about shitty service every day
@AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario
@AmericanAir there are no more flights via united when I arrive to DFW and my car is parked at IAH üòÅ
@AmericanAir your online site doesn't have flights listed in chronological order, resulting in a mis-purchase. Anything that can be done?
@AmericanAir I FOUND MY FOOTAGE!! :D I am so so happy.
@AmericanAir well we cleared customs in AUH. I need to get to IAH after I arrive in DFW. Is it possible to retrieve my luggage in IAD?
@AmericanAir I will and I will share with many, many others. #filmcrew #media @WSJ @nytimes @latimes @chicagotribune
@AmericanAir tell me you can get me to ABI earlier than 8 pm tomorrow

@AmericanAir $600 Late Flightr, 2 complete itinerary changes, and lost work and time, but yeah "I" got it rebooked
@americanair Not surprised that you were the Fastest Responding US Brand on Twitter for Q2 + Q3 2014. Also 10th fastest in the world in Q3
@AmericanAir you've got to be kidding. Look at the pictures.  I'm hoping it's on the flight that just came in. The whole story is 2 much
@AmericanAir You're clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I'd have missed funeral.
Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper "she's still at the hotel, she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow"
@AmericanAir do you have hand sanitizer in the bathrooms on your flights?
@AmericanAir I'm at the airport right now and your people didn't know how to react and help me with this situation. Very frustrated.
@AmericanAir Thank you
@AmericanAir So break whatever you want, take no responsibility..Too bad for customer? #media #filmcrew @chicagotribune @WSJ #nytimes @CNN

@AmericanAir No apology necessary. It was wind and I was on Delta. XOXO
@AmericanAir YOU FUCKING SUCK
@AmericanAir thank you
@AmericanAir on our way now
@AmericanAir I am traveling from AUH to IAD via etihad and then from IAD to DFW via AA. Will I be able to retrieve my checked bag in IAD?

@AmericanAir sent
@AmericanAir what about flight 1239?
@AmericanAir thanks to AA / DART for getting me home in time for work this morning DEN-DFW... didn't have to waste a vaca day @dartmedia
@AmericanAir even followed me, but I still can't get them to answer their phones. Worst. Customer "service". Ever. #customerservice #fail
@AmericanAir yeah and what are they gunna? Nothing your whole organization is a joke
@AmericanAir My sister just received a call that her trip Wednesday (flts 2348/3499) was Cancelled Flightled and resched to next day. Why?

@AmericanAir It says on you web site that u fly directly from ORD to DUB. when I try to book it says you do not. Have you stopped ?
@AmericanAir Glad to hear that there were no serious injuries in the minor crash @dfwairport this evening.
@AmericanAir I booked it on US Airways site. Don't see a Cancelled Flight link :(
@AmericanAir we had to sit in the airport a long periolodicly time. the planes were nasty
@AmericanAir With snow/ice forecast DFW Tu pm-We am what is change policy on reservations we hold Wed morning? Any leeway??
@AmericanAir no space in my seat but thanks to your pilots I'm back 25mn early to Ohare!! Didn't think that was possible!! #sna2ord #1644
@AmericanAir Late Flight again geez flt2417 #Late Flight #delays #typical
@AmericanAir do you guys have wifi on international flights?
@AmericanAir to add insult to injury, I have to go pick it up myself. Real class act! I'll stick the Delta from now on.
@AmericanAir absolutely disappointed in your lack of service. Lost my bag and can't even deliver it after I was told it would happen.
@AmericanAir Just followed you.
@AmericanAir What are Preferred Seats?
@AmericanAir what can AA do for a load of people about to board their 5th plane of a very long day when the first 4 were unserviceable
@AmericanAir the Late Flightst usair4603. Earlier 4591
@AmericanAir any delays on tonight's flight from DFW to SAT? I have family members on board.
@AmericanAir what is going on with the flight 2417? It has been delay a lot .
@AmericanAir Can I use an SWU on an Finnair codeshare of an American operated flight (JFK-MAN)?  Thanks in advance for the help!
@AmericanAir We tried with multiple people. I already sat on the phone for an hour and a half and got nowhere.
@AmericanAir which one.?i have been booked on 6 different ones in the past 2 days
@AmericanAir Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed.
@AmericanAir doesn't care about customers, break your gear and tell u they can't do anything. @WSJ @latimes @chicagotribune #media #filmcrew
@AmericanAir yes....twice...for two different flights and occasions
@AmericanAir Why is your cover photo of TWA? Just wondering.
@AmericanAir unable to access the website.  Will try again.
@AmericanAir yikes.
.@AmericanAir Hopefully it's all fixed. They've got a new aircraft for us- just waiting to board.
@AmericanAir Best planes in the business. NOT? AA5411 today. http://t.co/I7Vdi9WqSF
@AmericanAir @USAirways I need to Cancelled Flight a flight I booked earlier tonight. Are you able to do it over Twitter?
@AmericanAir I loved todays fight. But there was a bad draft on the airplane please add more air to air thanksm
Keep it up :) @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.
@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.
@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke
@AmericanAir Pay for my accommodations when you are the ones Cancelled Flightling it for no reason and I know your saying (lying) it cause of weather
@AmericanAir airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will
@AmericanAir This is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth
@AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight
@AmericanAir Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have
@AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
@AmericanAir I've just received the ticket. Thank you for your help
@AmericanAir jet slides off icy taxiway at @dfwairport 

STORY: http://t.co/4pONJ3jidE http://t.co/3DCWerZ1kr
@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
@AmericanAir on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane, now the lines are frozen.
@AmericanAir so disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys
@AmericanAir thanks
@AmericanAir You found my lost luggage, won't bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn't nicer. Terrible service
@AmericanAir Would it be ok to send you a DM asking a few questions because i'm deaf and been on hold so long?
@AmericanAir "sorry you were disappointed" #outoftouchwithreality #people have kids and jobs
@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 It's not allowing me to book available seats
@AmericanAir seriously, all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids.
@AmericanAir of delays and trapped on planes with no water or air. Never ever ever again. #neveragain #aafail
@AmericanAir LITERALLY just told me they'd rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to Dr. appointment. WOW
@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
@AmericanAir If it's in my backpack, why do I need to see agent?
@AmericanAir I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
@AmericanAir she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.
@AmericanAir Hi AA ! I placed an itin on hold to expire on 2/27.Just logged into my acct..its gone! Seat hasn't been released to inv. Help?
@AmericanAir  TPA - ORD!!! AA1679 Another successful journey, thanks for the hospitality!
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response. Much appreciated!
@AmericanAir 4369. about 4 flights all using same gate w/buses to the planes.  Awful boarding process. Hour and a half Late Flight
@AmericanAir is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money?
@AmericanAir @Rizzilient After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules.  help!
@AmericanAir Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn't even try to help!
@AmericanAir any idea why flight 5392 from HSV to DFW tomorrow Cancelled Flightled about 45 minutes ago?
@AmericanAir thanks.  I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed.  Guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/XGgCNTco8m
@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
@AmericanAir Did the policy change? I've seen people with hamsters and rabbits before.
@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
@AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.
@AmericanAir I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
@AmericanAir right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.
@AmericanAir obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. No hotel, no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry
@AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous
@AmericanAir my 2498 to CLT left the gate. What is next for CLT. Need help
@AmericanAir you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting
@AmericanAir still on hold. After you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) http://t.co/IMRLAu77iH
@AmericanAir if it I have not rebooked didn't get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled
@AmericanAir is that the flight for tomorrow?
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @TheCandaceSmith Thanks for the shout-out, Candace! Enjoy the ride.‚Äù Always! I adore American Airlines!
Without notifying though? ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @krescate We don't like Cancelled Flightling flights, Kim, but weather has not played nice with us."
Still thinking, those PJs may have me sold @AmericanAir @momsgoodeats We'd #love to have you on board with us! @MandarinJourney here I come
@AmericanAir Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
@AmericanAir how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty
@AmericanAir customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money
@AmericanAir im still on hold...
@AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.
@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
@AmericanAir Do we get a class discount on your wifi? I will be flying your airlines at approx. 4 Am?
@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.
@AmericanAir @contactcej thanks!
@AmericanAir @americanairlines #BQONPA flight #1641 delayed from POS-MIA, missed #2214 MIA- ATL need seat on last flight to ATL.
@AmericanAir SO BAD service in Miami, AirPort..
@AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @Delta would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service
@AmericanAir are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money?
@AmericanAir why do you continually play the "according to federal regulations" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service...
@AmericanAir can I send you my trusted traveler ID to add to my reservation for tsa pre?
@AmericanAir thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport?????
@AmericanAir the folks at the Executive Platinum desk are great pros.  They understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW.
@AmericanAir He thanks you. Anything you can do to help. Would any further information help in the process?
@AmericanAir thanks for a Cancelled Flightled flight then a delayed flight and NOT telling us More missed work More $ on hotel #WorstCustomerService
@AmericanAir Flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? I spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an EP agent on the phone now this?
.@AmericanAir Advised GAs and pilot of my flight. Too bad no one took action.
@AmericanAir @USAirways need to be reported to the @BBB_media for their complete disregard for paying customers! #DoNotFlyWithThem
@AmericanAir anything in particular I should ask for.   Will they want me to document my mileage plus status!
@AmericanAir how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it
@AmericanAir I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I'm disappointed.
@AmericanAir congrats on your call center customer service! A guy named Fidencio answered and he went above &amp; beyond to help me! üëåüëåüëå
@AmericanAir daughter record loc. is KYBILC. She is traveling with 3 y.o. and needs to be in adjacent seats, not across isle.
@AmericanAir Gabriela in Miami is a very rude employee.Working the MIA-LGA check In. She made experience unpleasant.  #customerexperience
@AmericanAir ok makes no sense tho Since you'll give me a free upgrade to first.
@AmericanAir I didn't want to Cancelled Flight, I wanted to take someone off and keep my price. Held at 402, at 10am today 440, now 530
@AmericanAir it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.
@AmericanAir would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?
@AmericanAir 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.
@AmericanAir @maryella_green despite the inconvenience, the situation was handled quickly and we appreciate it very much!
@AmericanAir Absolutely!
@AmericanAir - cluster continues-still on connecting instead of direct..bag charged and seats not together. #shafted
@AmericanAir @USAirways - I'm pregnant with twins and you're going to abandon me overnight in an airport? No hotel? When it's your fault?
@AmericanAir has no idea what they're doing. Delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another TO THE SAME DESTINATION  @ THE SAME TIME.
@AmericanAir @maryella_green just received it, actually. Thank you!!!!!!!!!
@AmericanAir are flights from Pensacola fl delayed flight 3670

@AmericanAir have such a bad rep for loosing costumers luggage. I stopped flying them a while back.
@AmericanAir @jokerunning this happened to me too!!!
@AmericanAir why did you drop my call. Why don't you have more people answering phones? Why is it always high call volume when I call

@AmericanAir can you help me update a birthday that was incorrectly input in a reservation? This is preventing me from checking in
@AmericanAir yep as I saidi feel sorry for you that you have to run their account how embarrassing for you

@AmericanAir your DCA baggage claim employees should realize a please, a thank you and an apology can go a long way #customerservice #DCA
@AmericanAir  2/2 You took cost for both flights out of my bank account. Now I can't get a refund for 2 weeks? I have been a loyal customer.
@AmericanAir I took the day off from work and drove 9 hours round trip to rescue my daughter and 3 other students from LaGuardia. Thanks!
@AmericanAir you're airline is ridiculous

@AmericanAir Is there a way I can get a record of all the flights I've taken with you?
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response, we got it resolved at the counter.
@AmericanAir that's the one. My original arrival time was 10:14am, after all said and done I may be there by 9:19pm central. Not impressed.

@AmericanAir rebooked into a different airport. Throwing a wrench into plans üëÄ
@AmericanAir crew did the best they could but it was out of their control. You only get one chance of a honeymoon &amp; you failed miserably
@AmericanAir Thx, someone picked up after 45 minutes
@AmericanAir overbooked business class from Mia to uvf - after being in the correct seat we were moved back to economy on our special day
@AmericanAir no kidding! Gonna take some beating on the apron... And there are some good lookin' planes out there!
@AmericanAir that's unacceptable
@AmericanAir so what if I didn't have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral
@AmericanAir I have to miss a whole days worth of work tomorrow but I'm suree you guys don't care
@AmericanAir this is a big company should be happy to do something for a customer when now it's costing more for delays oh and did I mention
@AmericanAir I have a ticket that has been pending for 4 days. Is it normal to take that long?? I want to make sure there isn't a problem.
@AmericanAir and just bad cs! I will be back on @JetBlue  at least when you stuck they look out for you and apologize for any trouble

@AmericanAir I'd just like to know where my bag is, when I'll get it and why I don't have it already. No accountability from Cust Service.
@AmericanAir I will never fly with you guys again! I am stuck in memphis another day. Called to be credit something anything
@AmericanAir - don't be jealous.  I live in Sydney and my T-shirt and jeans don't suit the office for work. I need suits and a warm jacket.
@AmericanAir @Rizzilient I booked tickets using miles and need to change the dates.  Have been trying to get to an advantage rep 4 two days
@AmericanAir is the company from hell with NO consideration for customers that give it hundreds of millions of dollars per year #SMH
@AmericanAir No snow in St. Louis. Cold but no snow. Hub flights welcome.
@AmericanAir Took a flight yesterday fron TPA-DFW-AUS. Bag went to IAH. Today bag went to IAH-DFW and then back to IAH. Still no bag!
@AmericanAir it is absolutely unacceptable.  I have been calling all day and am hung up on every time. I just need a 5 minute bit of help!
@AmericanAir - Envoy Airlines is a disgrace to the AA family.  Nothing but delays and Cancelled Flightlations, week after week.
@AmericanAir It's not about weather, it's logistics. Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me? Why not get more desk agents?
@AmericanAir We've sent you more info via DM.  I truly hope you resolve this very quickly. #media #filmcrew #cnn #nbc
@AmericanAir I've never had anything bad to say until now. No love for faithful customers.
@AmericanAir Also Agent not aware clearly of http://t.co/FWKJ49B1LE

@AmericanAir amen!
@AmericanAir No Meelan did not afford a supervisor to be included in the conversation, pls check the rec of the call #badcustomerservice
@AmericanAir I had it until last night, but because "severe weather" I could make the needed changes and now fair goes up 150 each.
@AmericanAir Thanks to AA for the upgrade today and getting me on a new flight after my first one was Cancelled Flightled!
@AmericanAir has the worst flight change policy. No mercy, no sympathy, such a bummer when you can't go to funerals or see friends bc of it.
@AmericanAir what's done is done. Not much you can do at this point. Trip is already over.
@AmericanAir basically u right now http://t.co/IN24Bpb7dw
@AmericanAir #epicfail on connections in #Chicago today, extremely disappointed w/ unaccommodating customer service, rethinking loyalty üòê
@AmericanAir well I'm flying @JetBlue instead - for free! Their credits actually work.
@AmericanAir just messaged you. Please have someone contact us immediately.
@AmericanAir why can't @dfwairport have the capability to spread salt on a runway?!
@AmericanAir 3349, was supposed to be in little rock at 10am this morning.

@AmericanAir not only on both legs did I have damaged seat, u damaged an expensive case and not offered anything.Just an apology 6wks Late Flightr!
@AmericanAir @USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that
@AmericanAir @USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it...
@AmericanAir My chariot tonight. From this angle it looks like a 787, no? http://t.co/3ZZKQWWbJz
@AmericanAir @USAirways day has come where I was suppose to get my money back from you but my bank hasn't received anything but after
@AmericanAir no I will be calling corporate!
@AmericanAir cannot understand how you are part of oneworld all other member treat their customers fairly #tcf #oldplanes #damageluggage

@AmericanAir I've tried...its @USAirways anyway
@AmericanAir oh I did. All I received back was an email saying " delays happen".. Uh huh..
@AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.
@AmericanAir Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated
@AmericanAir Flight Get Me Out Of Chicago.
@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight
@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing.
@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
@AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating
@AmericanAir I understand they're busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk
@AmericanAir HELP U said ud chnge our retrn flght since we missed our connection Sat &amp; now ur not pickng up the phone.Only hve 18 hrs left!
@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
@AmericanAir how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.
@AmericanAir so, what should he do next exactly?!
@AmericanAir Flight for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. New one booked. Seats taken care of. Just a tweet to commend you all on the service. Thanks!
@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
@AmericanAir he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.
@AmericanAir See photo of B787 scale model &amp; our PN 320008A wheel deflator specified in Chapter 32 of B787 AMM. http://t.co/kfD4WQRkLW
@AmericanAir I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight
@AmericanAir See photo of 787 model &amp; our PN 320008A wheel deflator specified in Chapter 32 of B787 AMM. http://t.co/oilnCfWEyg

@AmericanAir are pets allowed in first class?
@AmericanAir can lie to you about where your lost bag is, but we are suppose to trust them with our lives thousands of feet in the air...
@AmericanAir Can't help now as all seats have been taken.  There has to be a way to handle high volume of call days.
@AmericanAir the worst first class boarding service I ever had.
@AmericanAir most disgusting chicken entree I've ever seen.  Your standards have seriously nosedived. #NewAmerican http://t.co/56eSsfOOwt

@AmericanAir Delaney and Shawn at DFW showed exceptional customer service today. Will happily choose AA whenever possible now! Thank you!
@AmericanAir Another customer non service from you. If we waited for you to solve the problem we would miss the funeral. You suck!
@AmericanAir already shared with them. Nothing done!
@AmericanAir @kanne822 @SouthwestAir is better than AA.
@AmericanAir I really can't there though to an agent, and I am worried about my reservation. Can you help me out!
@AmericanAir while listening to a delay message on my phone, another delay message was coming in. Get your shit together!
@AmericanAir Hi. Get error msg when trying to check in on line. States: wrong pass#. Tickets rcvd from AA due to training in DFW. U know Y?
@AmericanAir there's an employee at gate 45 of JFK telling people their bag doesn't fit and needs to be checked when it clearly fits #AA291
@AmericanAir thanks... I finally got through this afternoon.  :)
@AmericanAir after waiting for a delayed plane, we sat on the plane for an hour waiting for a Late Flight passenger. That's BS too..
@AmericanAir WHERE IS MY BAG?!?!?!
@AmericanAir it was 639
@AmericanAir Not true!! Stop making excuses! You either overbook or have crappy planes!
@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines on approach to mex.... http://t.co/se57dmjHiW
@AmericanAir no. Booked seat in Dallas, live in Dallas. Real nice that your gate agent had exit row available told me they weren't available
@AmericanAir I paid using Paypal online and after I was charged there was a "System Error" which is what I ended up calling about.
@AmericanAir #AATeam thanks for working in very rigorous weather conditions for all
@AmericanAir that's why I'm asking for exception. Staffer moving last minute,we're a nonprofit &amp; losing $400,we just want to change ticket.
@AmericanAir thanks, I'll look forward to the response.
@AmericanAir your advantage agents are horrible! I've been waiting for 5 hours for a call back only to be hung up on by a rude agent!
@AmericanAir yes there's issues on the site as well unfortunately.
@AmericanAir about when can I see a new American Airlines credit card to replace my USAIRWAYS dividend MasterCard?
@AmericanAir my wife is stuck in #Brownsville any chance she can get any flight out? She needs to be at work tomorrow morning.
@AmericanAir Will it be this year, do you think?
@AmericanAir thank you, truly appreciate the help, just sent a DM
@americanair the best is your 800 message saying to use website and your website is saying you need to call.  If you don't answer, #hardtodo
@AmericanAir Trying to get my flight changed through dallas. Calling your number just says thanks for calling and hangs up. Guess I'm stuck
@AmericanAir AA1675 now that the airplane has been sitting here for over 24 hrs,there are mechanical problems.BTW,the AA desk is unorganized
@AmericanAir Miami-PhL flight Cancelled Flightled just as I got to the gate. No one from AA around, no one on the phone. Awful awful awful.
@AmericanAir Can care less if youre without your bags for a day or a week! Ive been 3 stories in the last 3 hours...I WANT MY BAG!
@AmericanAir hah, best flight attendant response, if you not happy getting screwed over, you have other carriers.   hahahah pathetic
@AmericanAir AA1675 flight out of Jamaica was Cancelled Flightled yesterday due to "weather", while other flights were still landing at DFW
@AmericanAir boarding in 2mins YAY!!!!
@AmericanAir your a LIAR, no precipitation all day, 47 degrees, don't pacify, you look like a fool.......thats the problem, admit you suck
@AmericanAir Thank you so much.
@AmericanAir 12 calls in the span of two days........none of which available to speak to someone.  You are un F-in believable.  worst ever
@AmericanAir @elwoodblues77 I'm sure he understands the rules but you guys just have zero customer service. Staff your damn counters!
@AmericanAir What's with your baggage handlers calling out at DFW today? No luggage onboard the planes.
.@AmericanAir after 50 minutes on hold, and another 30 minutes on the call yes. Going to be pushing it to get to the airport on time now
@AmericanAir Hi, did the discount award policy for credit card holders change? No longer seeing the chart of specials on the site. Thanks!
@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?
@AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day
@AmericanAir Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn't make up for PHX error and attitude! #Americant
@AmericanAir will not let me reuse my ticket.  Thus I have booked my vacation with Delta!  Never flying on American again......
@AmericanAir now 2 hrs! Guess I should just hang up &amp; give up on using my award miles before prices jump? Hm thanks http://t.co/LE4H2gTzXZ
@AmericanAir Need to hold or get a call back. Just get hung up on by your phone system for 6+ hours now.
@AmericanAir she was rude, unprofessional,  not helpful in helping me try and get home. As a #aaadvantage #loyal aa customer dissatisfied!
@AmericanAir work on the comm skills w hate agents at PHX. Said I was confirmed on flight out of DFW &amp; got here and that was only standby.
@AmericanAir thank you for the assistance
@AmericanAir Hello, question, How many balloons do you think it will take to life up one of your planes?
@AmericanAir need2know if Ill be able to reach IND today.Rather stay in MAF that fly to DFW &amp; find out I can't travel http://t.co/gVgKHbx1RB
@AmericanAir I'm trying my hardest to not get frustrated, but I am getting no response on email or by phone. AA owes me $500. How do I claim
@AmericanAir hi there flight from Dallas just Cancelled Flightled going to LA. Can u pls help rebook me?
@AmericanAir 2nd time in 4 days that my flight has been delayed and my gate agent hasn't said anything! Thanks for the memories. #NeverAgain
@AmericanAir Thanks for doing that but now it's telling me to go to the airport and check in with an agent-what's up? http://t.co/PfseNJk5Pw
@AmericanAir what's the best number to use?
@AmericanAir have been in call cue for 11 hours. No call yet. Wife in cue for 9 hours.  Got a call but was hung up on.
@AmericanAir been on the phone for 47 minutes...said it would be 10...  Any advice?
@AmericanAir Chicago seen from seat 6A, AA 1620. So far a great ride! On to PDX! http://t.co/X4rsvAGIjN
@AmericanAir thanks. Delivery status??
@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
@AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn't allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address?
@AmericanAir our flight AA 1338 is delayed out of Providenciales and will be missing our connection AA 1651 in Miami to SEA. Who do we call?
@AmericanAir here is the ticket they gave me after lying, raising their voice. With no explanation on what happened http://t.co/31cFHtK60r
@AmericanAir we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail
@AmericanAir attached original ticket. flight number was 1672. isn't the experience I thought I would have. Terrible! http://t.co/5SdlyN9MSS
@AmericanAir I had booked online but unable to Cancelled Flight online. But finally got thru.
@AmericanAir Hey Becky Piela at the Orange County airport has been really kind and helpful with rescheduling our flight!
@AmericanAir on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I'd be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation.
@AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice
@AmericanAir our flight attendant announced that we have transportation waiting for us for that flight so I think we'll make it.
@AmericanAir been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? http://t.co/cEHrOeurC5
@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.
@AmericanAir Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time.
@AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher
@AmericanAir so whats the hold up on flight 4302?
@AmericanAir Well, you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. Bar none, the best SM team in the airline industry in my opinion.
@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
@AmericanAir After being patient about my "delayed" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!
@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.
@AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night
@AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline.
@AmericanAir Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I'd have to take a 2nd day off work.
@AmericanAir been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said "we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch"!
@AmericanAir Considering it was past midnight, I hung up and called again to receive another service call.
@AmericanAir can I redeem AAdavantage miles on LAN flights?
@AmericanAir, I've tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST.  I'm having no luck -help!
@AmericanAir Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour.
@AmericanAir You lost a customer today. Flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday.
@AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice
@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
@AmericanAir thanks
@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take
@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply
@AmericanAir is there a probability that flight 1330 from DFW to DTW will be delayed or Cancelled Flighted?
@AmericanAir THANK YOU!!! üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
@AmericanAir Uhmmm we need @JColeNC down in Dallas,Tx for his tour üò´üò´üò´
@AmericanAir is there a way to reserve my dog‚Äôs flight without speaking with a representative? Just was booted from your helpline!
@AmericanAir I've been calling you for 3 straight days and no one picks up. Sure there are storms but there are also #customers Holler!
@americanair Can you tell me where my luggage is? I was on flight 1644 SNA to DFW and my flight to MKE was Cancelled Flightled, so got rebooked to ORD
@AmericanAir it's GTSVYB. It says it's Cancelled Flightled when I try to check.
@AmericanAir thank you. They are processing my refund.
@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?
@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions.
@AmericanAir Thanks for asking On second plane after maintenance issue, for flight from ORD to LIT. Sitting at gate in very very warm plane
@AmericanAir hey ho its not me losing any money (only you) just next make sure you stick to the "flyers right's booklet"
@AmericanAir please dm me
@AmericanAir Trying for 20 hrs to reach agent. Must make change that can't be done on web by 11:59 PST. Had to Cancelled Flight revs ystday.
@AmericanAir Oh, and losing my luggage #ridiculous # angrybird # where'smybag
@AmericanAir great job and great service in and out of SDF this weekend during the winter storm.
@AmericanAir please get it together and find my husbands luggage! You're ruining his ski trip to Aspen! 3rd day no luggage.
@AmericanAir but don't you worry... @Delta took good care of me... Your loss, their gain.
@AmericanAir welcome anyone who works in those conditions deserves a thank you even though I am other side of #Atlantic lol xx
@AmericanAir could you check if there is SWU (typo in last post) space on AA199 MXP-JFK Feb 28th? Thanks
@AmericanAir could you check if there is SVU space on AA199 MXP-JFK Feb 28th? Thanks
@AmericanAir Thanks gang! Mind if I ask, do you handle all of your Social Media in house?
@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.
@AmericanAir thanks for telling me my flight got Cancelled Flightled when it wasn't. Now I have a missing luggage because of you. Thanks fam!
@AmericanAir yes I have. Thanks
@AmericanAir 77min still on hold to chg award travel #sorrynotsorry
@AmericanAir Your people on the phone can't see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That's a poor process then...
@AmericanAir i got a new reservation for tomorrow. Thanks!
@AmericanAir I have a couple questions for you, if you‚Äôre available for PM?
@AmericanAir Is my friends flight 386 from JAX to DFW Cancelled Flighted?
@AmericanAir still not taking calls ?   Storm ended 2 days ago. Be like pats and #doyourjob
@AmericanAir $90 dollar RT ticket to Chicago? Yes, Please!
@AmericanAir Thank you
@AmericanAir Let's all have a extraordinary week and make it a year to remember #GoingForGreat 2015 thanks so much American Airlines!!!
@AmericanAir not helpful
@AmericanAir you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume, however, you never make acpt
@AmericanAir but my friend was told she was able to use her credit with the airline towards one of my flights, then was told she couldn't.
@AmericanAir hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. http://t.co/4KbTzVjU3b
@AmericanAir well you spelled my name wrong.
@AmericanAir 2 hours now!  No I'm not patient.  Why don't you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone, not tweet #onhold
@AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
@AmericanAir no standby line update online or on app either is troubling
@AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #WakingInMemphis
@AmericanAir thx, just sent the DM
@AmericanAir Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up!
@americanair thanks to your airline I now have a ruined bag and you refuse to do anything about it.
@AmericanAir 4 open kiosks for priority with no line and only 4 open for main check in for ~80-100 ppl
@AmericanAir I have the app - after my nonsense flight Cancelled Flightation yesterday I wasn't able to use the app or kiosk today. Hour long line.
@AmericanAir Thank u! Did reach out to both and have not had a response yet. Lost and Found goes straight to VM.
@AmericanAir "bag has not yet been located". Again, 5th time I've checked it. How can tracking my bag be this hard for your system?
@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!
@AmericanAir @maxfitgirl29 next time fly Southwest...
@AmericanAir Still on hold. Way to suck.
@AmericanAir Kudos to the crew of Flt 167 today. Specially to Carlton. Loved your new 767-300. Keep up the good work AA!
@AmericanAir are flights leaving Dallas right now? In Maui trying to figure out how delayed flight 7 is going to be
@AmericanAir, ask your new colleagues @USAirways how they handled US 728 on 21 Feb. I expect to be made whole again. Check complaint inbox.
@AmericanAir get me outta here
@americanair just tried calling. got a high call volume at this moment message and then it said goodbye and hung up‚Ä¶
@AmericanAir really appreciate the great customer service... One of your service agents just hung up on me when asking legitimate questions
@AmericanAir don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.
@AmericanAir Thank you. It's much appreciated. We have been on the plane for 90 min now at the gate.
@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it
@AmericanAir On hold since 5am. When no one can get to the airport, Cancelled Flight flight, don't make us pay huge fee to change flight.
@AmericanAir All of the nicest people in the world work at Admiral's clubs. Gladys in San Juan es mi Amiga
@AmericanAir due to road conditions
@AmericanAir I was going to change it to tomorrow because I am concerned if the fllight does make I won't be able to leave the airport   1/2
@AmericanAir I love very much your planes, can you please follow me back? It's an amazing bussines!
@AmericanAir so if your genuine, give me your opinion  on what occurred last night 445 fly  from phl, to mia. No assistance at airport
@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
@AmericanAir Way to suck at customer service, Dallas is trapped in an ice storm but you didn't Cancelled Flight 7am flight &amp; been on hold all day.
@AmericanAir umm unexpected?? Unexpected meaning you guys didn't know you had a major staff shortage ??
@AmericanAir Also do you have any way to speak to someone on the phone? Your 1-800 # has been hanging up on me all day.
@AmericanAir SFO. Natt (the agent who helped me) really did an awesome job.
@AmericanAir I paid seat upgrade b4 the severe weather.  Got booked on another flight but did not get upgrade. Was calling to inquire. HELP!
@AmericanAir thanks!
@AmericanAir well Done all of you xx
@AmericanAir Thanks. Having issues checking in for flight, please check our DM convo for more info.
@AmericanAir You don't care about keeping your customers safe or at least you didn't care about my sister
@AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.
@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too
@AmericanAir When will callers from the East Coast be able to speak to an actual human for reservation support? All agents busy call Late Flightr..
@AmericanAir My father loved working for you as well as PanAm
@AmericanAir 249 EWR - DFW is now stopping BNA to refuel 4 bad weather? Are YOU just trying to get the plane closer 2 DFW then Cancelled Flight on us?
@AmericanAir is there something wrong with the website? no matter what flight I select, it says it's no longer available.
@AmericanAir now you're sending a gate agent to talk to us? Joke of an airline. Thanks for ruining my vacation. #neverflyAAagain
@AmericanAir  CXL flight. rebooked 2 PAX no problems. Thank you and everyone at AA for helping us all out!
@AmericanAir we have been sitting on the plane for over an hour. unacceptable. you have a complete disregard for customer service.
@AmericanAir I wrote down the evoucher number. I got rid of the voucher when I purchased air fair
@AmericanAir Only fluctuated because aa took 2 hrs to call me back.Ended up paying (extra) in $US so above statement not true
@AmericanAir @MattThomasNews When did American Airlines start flying to and from Siberia? Wait, this is the USA? Oy!
@AmericanAir followback
@AmericanAir Hahaha.... "Meanwhile in Russia...."
@AmericanAir thanks for keeping us safe
@AmericanAir There was no one from #AA at the #woase2015 event @HelsinkiAirport
Lots of info available of #winterops
@AmericanAir is that the "record locator"?
@AmericanAir you keep returning my call and hanging up when I answer? Help reFlight Booking Problems a flight!
@AmericanAir been calling for over 24hrs now and getting no where but told to call back by the automated system is extremely frustrating
@AmericanAir just sad that even after spending so much on tickets all I wanted was for my wife to still go with her sister and no help
@AmericanAir @USAirways you can help by now finding my baggage!!  Reply to me ASAP with who I can direct details to.
@AmericanAir no. Prebook flight for wife's 40th bday in NO. I recently have had surgery and can't travel. Won't let another go in my place
@AmericanAir 4hrs Late Flightr i get a call back, and immediately disconnected
@AmericanAir My pleasure, next AA flight - this Wednesday to Milan, Italy for @MIDOExhibition -- See you then! :)
@AmericanAir your team rebooked my Cancelled Flightled AA flight on a different airline. New airline has no such Flight Booking Problems. Flight is this evening.
@AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous
@AmericanAir I don't like making a scene but this hasn't been addressed properly. Please have them do that.
@AmericanAir THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HELP!  :P You guys are the best.  #americanairlines #americanair
@AmericanAir @derekc21  Hello any one out there ? have you forgotten me ?  I need a  luggage # for BA.  Your dropping the ball here .
@AmericanAir am on hold for the 2nd time today. Need help with confirming the new flights you arranged for me. Can you expedite this?
@AmericanAir served the nastiest food Ive ever seen yesterday.Rubber chicken in slime. The ENTIRE cabin sent their food back.FAs can confirm
@AmericanAir  terrible response! How about someone picking up the phone and calling me...It is now 49 Hours with no luggage
@AmericanAir really
@AmericanAir how can I when system always hangs up on me?
@AmericanAir DM sent
@AmericanAir exceptional customer service from AA - my misplaced item was waiting for me at checkin followed by a smooth flight. Thank you!
@AmericanAir in line at SFO. Customer service is rude, disorganized, and congested. Very dissapointing.
@AmericanAir HELP! Attempting to Cancelled Flight a flight but can't get thru 800 number. Call gets dropped when saying Agent. flight is 2/24.
@AmericanAir okay. I just sent it.
@AmericanAir @EdPlotts don't bother trying to get anywhere with their customer service team either as take 2+ months and counting to reply
@AmericanAir thanks.....
@AmericanAir seriously, you treat your passengers like shit.
@americanair 30 minutes since landing - flight 1531 from Miami and no luggage- what's the delay
@AmericanAir got it, so it's just paying extra not to sit in the way back. Awesome. Never again.
@AmericanAir Define "sincerely". Your actions do not reflect what you're saying in a poor attempt to redeem yourselves on social media.
@AmericanAir I'd like to explore both options, and what the cost might be to change the date and destination.

@AmericanAir you said this last time. It doesn't take 6 weeks to reply to an email.
@AmericanAir sure, thank you!
@AmericanAir I need some help. My record locator is bringing up TWO different flights in your system. One op by AA &amp; one from US Airways.
@AmericanAir I'm trying to make a reservation with a &lt; 2 year old lap child. Don't see any option online. How do I proceed with reservation?
@AmericanAir 45min wait to get de-iced in Tulsa.Not good service.Looks like everyone will miss connections, not due to weather. Fight is on
@AmericanAir my flight 1337 is Cancelled Flightled.  Can you let me know what my new flight info is?
@AmericanAir ...why would you sell seats for a 7 hour flight with half of the legroom occupied by an escape raft? http://t.co/DTHEyOFXrB
@AmericanAir dmed back
Yessir RT ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @yourlocalnyer Good morning, Rob. We're showing the flight to sunny Mexico just pushed off the gate.‚Äù
@AmericanAir My flight through Dallas was Cancelled Flightled and I talked to reservations agent and got a new flight but have not received an email
@AmericanAir #last #flight #ever on #AA. You botched this weather delay to the point of absurdity. I'd pay more to fly @Delta
@AmericanAir - I'd be happy to hold on the phone, but your phone system is not allowing that and simply hangs up.
@AmericanAir Trying desperately to rebook my moms flight. Waited 10 hours for callback, got disconnected and they didn‚Äôt call back. #help
@AmericanAir Thanks but don't understand why they couldn't have used the tug at the next gate over, ground crew took a break? #unacceptable
@AmericanAir That will be the third time I have been called by 800-433-7300 an hung on before anyone speaks. What do I do now???
@AmericanAir now the second flight I was put on was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation!! Missed my first meeting!!#outragedüò°üò°
@AmericanAir How clueless is AA. Been waiting to hear for 2.5 weeks about a refund from a Cancelled Flightled flight &amp; been on hold now for 1hr 49min
@AmericanAir F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C!! thanks again for coming thru with great customer service!
@AmericanAir No! We departed 24 hours Late Flightr, with a crazy crew. One of the lady simply freaked out and got away from job before departure.
@AmericanAir Don't require us to memorize a five-word phrase and remember it after we hear another six million options
@AmericanAir 2 months and still no exec platinum member cards. What gives?
@AmericanAir For the love of all that is holy, if your automated phone system is going to give like 8 options, give numerical shortcuts
@AmericanAir you can tweet but not call! You're like a bad boyfriend!
.@AmericanAir @TyWinter it's really the small things--the details--that make an excellent experience or a really irritating one.
@AmericanAir Thanks! Great stuff! I can only imagine how jammed everything is.
@AmericanAir @British_Airways trying to speak with an agent about my flight to London tonight but can't get anyone from AA.  Can you help?
@AmericanAir Oh,i already have turned  itover to them, but apparently losing someones bag on their honeymoon doesn't require accountability
@AmericanAir I've been trying to reach your customer service for TWO days. I have received zero response. Never traveling AA again.
@AmericanAir 6 hours to get backs back after being sat on a plane for 4 hours to have flight Cancelled Flightled with only one small drink
@AmericanAir @CNN @nbsnewsr @cnnbrk except you aren't working with her @AmericanAir youve done nothing to help
@AmericanAir need help on a reservation. Can you follow so that I can DM details? Thanks!
@AmericanAir you need to have a look at your handling of flight 106 and 104. Company of yours size should have protocols in place to help
@AmericanAir literally just stopped allowing people to wait in line for customer service. Incredible. From worst to no customer service.
@AmericanAir We've 15 official complaints signed by #AmericanAirlines Lima supervisor. Customer Relations pls compensate 4 the 10-hour delay
@AmericanAir I need to rebook and I cannot get an agent. Can you help?
@AmericanAir back in UK now no thanks to your staff that wouldn't me or the other passengers stranded. Just laughed at us

@AmericanAir flight home Cancelled Flightled today.  Any way we can get another flight to NYC from Texas? 4 hour wait for a call back from airline
@AmericanAir @justynmoro I totally agree.  You get the automatic phone attendent that goes NO WHERE and hangs up.  Lousy service!
@AmericanAir this receipt doesn't show the evoucher value nor does it mention having used an evoucher
@AmericanAir I've been trying to call your reservations desk for past 12 hours and can't get through.  This is not what I expected.
@AmericanAir customer service is terrible.Been waiting 6 weeks for a reply to an email. Not helpful at all and keep brushing off problems!
@AmericanAir it's taken care of already. I've come to expect this level of horrible service from you time and time again
@americanair why am I not being given a callback option??! Why has this service been turned off?
@AmericanAir I was flying today to MTY Mex at 9:30am but still appear Cancelled Flight, Where can i talk for another flight?
@AmericanAir You didn't call, did you. Try it, and then you'll understand.  It's not possible to reach an agent,I don't know what else to do
@AmericanAir Ok. We will probably Cancelled Flight our flights then, take a refund, and get home another way. Wednesday won't work for us.
@AmericanAir  that's what I am hoping for
@AmericanAir Also, I have to wait more than 2 hours before I can speak to someone on the phone?  I can't wait 2 hours.  :(
@AmericanAir make that 7hours now
@AmericanAir me too. Despite the chaos, I'm still grateful for a flight home ‚úàÔ∏è
@AmericanAir How am I supposed to Cancelled Flight it if I can't do it online?  I don't want to lose all the funds on the ticket.  HELP!!! :(
@AmericanAir poor customer service is just unacceptable.. Also how bout the surfer on the front of your website. #noloveforsurfers #pretend

@AmericanAir Retrain in Customer Service first, make proper adjustments when Cancelled Flightling flights. Own up to your Mistakes.
@AmericanAir wish you had a better mobile app.  You should look at the app from @united as it is much more seemless to check in
@AmericanAir delayed flight six hours. Missed international connection= extra night in a hotel and still have to pay for a 15lb surfboardbag
@AmericanAir dmed the name
@AmericanAir no vouchers 4 Cancelled Flighted flight due 2 weather. Today's issue, broken tire. No vouchers cause tire was broken by weather. #nomoAA

@AmericanAir long mait. Repair wait at gate - Capt Said "paperwork formality"- forced to check bag rudely-returning CC reader doesn't work
@AmericanAir One hour to check in is 45 minutes too long. MIA FAIL.
@AmericanAir thx for showing me that your Twitter appreciates me more than your employees. Sure another airline would like my $1300 #nohotel
@AmericanAir thanks! a response is better than nothing at all {ahem, @USAirways}
@AmericanAir I can't get through to a customer rep to help me out. This is the only option I have got.
@AmericanAir those were snacks we left on purpose for your team. :) for being so helpful this morning at the desk and on the phone!
@AmericanAir flight 353
@AmericanAir She could even see that I had tried to make the transaction but wouldn't offer me the price I'd tried to purchase it at.
@AmericanAir @USAirways "ma'am if you have a complaint you should visit our customer service desk" {sees line ~45 people deep}
@AmericanAir @united we'll have time and they aren't doing a damn thing. I'm the guy in the winter hat and frowny face
@AmericanAir So much for Status, EP and 1.5 million miles.  Revenue First class ticket and Im sitting in Coach thanks your rude CS staff
@AmericanAir @united just deplaned at O'Hare gate K13. Why don't you send a customer service rep to discuss my situation? God knows...
@AmericanAir I DM'd you. Anything you can do?
@AmericanAir By the time the 2 hrs passed before I got a call back, the ticket was more $$. It wasn't my fault yet I had to pay extra
@AmericanAir this is all i gotta say to y'all &amp; your staff... for real http://t.co/rKPRxTGvfL
@AmericanAir No, it wouldn't let me complete transaction because it was one way from Barbados to NYC
@AmericanAir: my brother's flight into DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday. Are you flying from ONT to DFW today?

@AmericanAir refund
@AmericanAir I'm still patiently waiting for a response to my complaint email on Fri. What is the normal response time?
@AmericanAir the flight I'm trying to change is in 4 hours and I've been trying to reach an agent for 72 now. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
@AmericanAir Why is it ok that no-one can help me with the bag you lost on my honeymoon 3months ago, this is not responsible or professional
@AmericanAir SJC-&gt;LAX. After the fourth time, I gave up!
@AmericanAir my flight to San Angelo via Dallas from Orlando Cancelled Flighted help! On hold and disconnect

@AmericanAir still no response from AA. great job guys!

@AmericanAir Howdy, having trouble getting rebooked after flight Cancelled Flightled. Can't get thru via phone and Web erroring out. Can you help?
@AmericanAir Oh yea? That's it? C'mon buddy! Bring your special friend @united to the conversation - they seem to be doing NOTHING AT ALL
@AmericanAir why are there only 2 agents at domestic check in at MIA?! WTF? Huge lines and many people with Cancelled Flightled flights.
@AmericanAir I was told I had a 20minute wait time after waiting hours. And an hour has gone by. This is ridiculous
@AmericanAir I dmed
@AmericanAir don't see response!
@AmericanAir gotta love those skycaps, solving problems faster than anyone else in the terminal. And they did it with a smile on their face
@AmericanAir you guys need to educate your employees on what a pink tag is AND STOP LOSING MY GUITAR FOR THE 10 THOUSANDTH TIME!
@AmericanAir pretty frustrating when you can't even stay on hold to get help after a flight Cancelled Flightation!
@AmericanAir @united You're both equally terrible, and I'm going to fight until I get complete satisfaction for how we were mistreated
@AmericanAir @united wrote back saying 'it's been a challenging week...that's for sure" - no shit.
@AmericanAir @united contact me, or do something to alleviate this terrible, terrible service. But no, your 22 year old social media guru
@AmericanAir @united week is going to make up for anything, or put me at ease.  You should be asking me how you can fix things, how to...
@AmericanAir @cnnbrk they didn't address the assult or drinks spilled on her  the drunk passenger had to have a wheelchair to get off plane
@AmericanAir @united and a complete lack of faith in your companies. It's really a shame that you think telling me "it's been a challenging"
@AmericanAir Priority baggage evidently means it comes out last
@AmericanAir @united getting us to where we need to be. This is not acceptable. Not to mention, Cancelled Flighting meetings/interviews for my client
@AmericanAir between your airline and @united I've now spent three extra days traveling (DOMESTIC) and spent hundreds of dollars...
@AmericanAir has the worst flights and customer service, this is the second time I've been Cancelled Flighted. Gotta pay for hotel and find rides now.
@AmericanAir flight from DC to LA, not to mention fix the circuit breaker in our bathrooms because this plane is as old as me...
@AmericanAir what an incredibly arrogant thing to say while I sit here at O'Hare waiting for your incompetent airlines to refuel on a...
@AmericanAir why is it from June 1 thru December 31 there are no bus/first milesaaver awards available from cun to nyc? #Explain #whyfly
@AmericanAir @cnnbrk she tried they are not doing anything said they would talk to stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
@AmericanAir please improve business extra flight reservation process. can't book online?  what century are we in? 25 min+ on hold
@AmericanAir I tried already and I am on the waiting list for a call back #2hourwaitsucks
@AmericanAir the most stressful morning and still had to pay to check a bag. LAX is a madhouse with a lot of angry customers. Yikes
@AmericanAir its only 1500 characters, i will respond via formal letter. Trust me, I have plenty to say.
@AmericanAir as of now, will do my best to never fly w/ #AmericanAirlines ever again. Y'all have made this a day to remember.
@AmericanAir 4 phone calls, 2 hrs of being sent back &amp; forth between two lines in the terminal and it's the skycap that finds a solution
@AmericanAir Thanks for the response.Tough night for all involved. Our flight got Cancelled Flightled as we started taxiing down the runway.

@AmericanAir thank you for responding rather quickly btw

@AmericanAir ok thank you!
@AmericanAir could you guys follow me so I can dm yall please
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighting my flight today because of weather in Dallas without being charged?
@AmericanAir No. I was told I got put on another flight and that I would get an email. Still haven't gotten one yet.

@AmericanAir flight delayed 3 times today due to flight officer. 4333 from pit to ord. 5 hour delay to date. #bademployeeproblem?
@AmericanAir --(pt 2) and the AA reservations phone number has been less than helpful, telling me to change things online when I can't.

@AmericanAir thank you for NOT Cancelled Flighting all flights and putting my husbands life in danger driving in this weather. #safetyfirst
@AmericanAir Are there any travel advisories for Toronto, ON today? I can't access anything regarding international travel on your website--

@AmericanAir two were non revs, right?
@AmericanAir check your DM please
@AmericanAir finally called! Can't get met Seattle so refund will be processed. Thanks
@AmericanAir My reservation is on hold, not me.  Wish I was on hold but that's not possible with the phone issues at #americanair
@AmericanAir the app doesn't allow Canadian address. I used the mobile Canadian site and it will not let you select a passenger.
@AmericanAir You are having phone issues.  Please fix it!!!!
@AmericanAir I can't!!!  No one can't get to "hold".  You can't get past the automated reply.  It hangs up on you.  #FRUSTRATED
@AmericanAir trying to get home is beyond complicated. It's should not be this hard. Students are split up and we will not fly AA ever again

@AmericanAir I sent you a DM, can you please help.
@AmericanAir awesome flight this morning on AA3230! Awesome crew and even landed early!
@AmericanAir yes. Just sayin' that was a particularly poorly handled situation.
@AmericanAir I had to pay extra $$ cos that flight was "no longer available" just because it wouldn't accept my US Card for a 1 way into NYC
@AmericanAir - And @AirSouthwest  had a flight from Chicago to Buffalo about an hour before our flight -- do they not care about safety?
@AmericanAir can you?
@AmericanAir Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can't get through.
@AmericanAir - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don't care about their safety?
@AmericanAir I've been in line for over half hour trying to see a representative, now I might even miss the next flight too, unacceptable
@AmericanAir been trying to speak to agent for 24hrs about my Cancelled Flightled flight but reps always busy. how do I get ahold of you?
@AmericanAir Please follow me.
@AmericanAir Any way that we could look at other options for today?
@AmericanAir you're almost as bad as @united
@AmericanAir @USAirways use the app you say?? http://t.co/WnY9TzsR8N
@AmericanAir there is two hour wait
@AmericanAir can't get thru to anyone on phone
@AmericanAir  when do you anticipate decisions for Cancelled Flightlations at DFW tomorrow morning? Need to rearrange hotel reservations, etc. ASAP!
@AmericanAir I saw it finally come through on the mobile app. However it's for tomorrow and I have meetings tonight that I'm trying to make.
@AmericanAir I've been calling your 1800 # all morning to change my name for an upcoming trip but am not able to get through. Please advise!
@AmericanAir @USAirways "but I take meds that make me severely dehydrated" {sigh}
@AmericanAir dm me your email address,  I will tell you my ordeal, then you tell me what you think is fair
@AmericanAir I did set up notifications through AA &amp; Us airways. still nothing
@AmericanAir how can I get travel question answered quickly... Online and calling not helping with this busy day
@AmericanAir  upon entering plane to 2 @USAirways stewardesses: "can I have some water?" "no we don't do that. please take your seat"
@AmericanAir The website won't let me view my reservation due to "changes made outside http://t.co/nwF2FkA8fY". I'm on hold now to get help.
@AmericanAir I meant can you use the 50k bonus sign up mileage for Alaska flights or only American?
@AmericanAir @USAirways outbound flight: 2 hour delay b/c air traffic &amp; 2 gate changes dividend miles member gets no email or text updates
@AmericanAir record locator oaaret got email we couldn't be rebooked but got no notification flight was Cancelled Flightled
@AmericanAir please confirm 2917 from CID-DFW at 11:30 departure will be/is Cancelled Flighted. Don't want to make the hour drive!
@AmericanAir Huge thanks for fixing our flights! appreciate the customer service. now if only i could get seats assigned: me next to my wife
@AmericanAir #oaaret is our flight Cancelled Flightled?
@AmericanAir it's not a friend it's a legally required chaperone on a school trip.
@AmericanAir @RLDelahunty record l#oaaret got email we couldn't get rescheduled on another flight but don't know if flight is Cancelled Flightled
@AmericanAir it's more than technical problems. #frustrated #answerthephone 
Res. on hold and can't get thru to use a credit to pay for it
@AmericanAir good morning, please let me know if I will be able to get those luggage tags.   Tx!
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted flights, now I'm rerouted and have over 12 hrs of travel but you will bump paying customers for non revs. #custserv
@AmericanAir on hold again....estimated 2 hr hold
@AmericanAir they sent her a letter and said they would talk to the stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
@AmericanAir Supervisor M.Robinson just served a lot of attitude, Cancelled Flighted my flight out of spite, then put me back on on #crazybitch
@AmericanAir at gate c11. Your gate agents are turning paying customers away in favor of non revs
@AmericanAir the one at 11:30am? My app still shows it as on time!
@AmericanAir @andyellwood @delk lol. I was sure I'd wake up to more of a response than this half-thought auto tweet. hope you made it out.
@AmericanAir AA2334 Second week in a row delayed, due to mechanical issues. All the sleet outside and yet we're stuck changing a tire
@AmericanAir  thanks hoping that by wed I can get back to DFW
@AmericanAir @Delta @VirginAtlantic I need a vacation from all this ice! http://t.co/45kTsSK18J
@AmericanAir keep trying to call to change reservation and you keep hanging up on me
@AmericanAir Will do. Appreciate the replies though.
@AmericanAir although there was a 6 hour delay every single staff member from the ticket desk to the admirals club in was as sweet as pie
@AmericanAir how are the runways at DFW? Will you be flying Late Flightr today? Thanks.
@AmericanAir BRING MY FIANC√â @meerikangas BACK TO ME!
@AmericanAir hahahaha! This is crazy! Well here's to another night at the airport!!
@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.
@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?
@AmericanAir @hoagy10 how about you stop cutting and pasting apologies and get some additional phone reps to do their jobs
@AmericanAir work would be much better with my lesson plans and music for my classes today.
@AmericanAir your call system is a fucking joke
@AmericanAir at LAX &amp; just got off the phone w/reservations. Every flight that'd get me to BOS before 11 am tmrw is apparently unavailable üòê
@AmericanAir are you anticipating weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightations for afternoon departures out of AUS today?
@AmericanAir No worries. Don't blame you for weather.
@AmericanAir You moved us onto 6.55pm but there is availability on 1.50 and 3.30.   No answer on your phone. Have young children.  HELP!
@AmericanAir It's our honeymoon,I paid extra business. I was sitting next to my bride, you bumped me because of status. Disgusted
@AmericanAir Deplaned for the 3rd fucking time. Fuck you AA.
@AmericanAir how do I redeem a travel voucher for a flight if I can't reach a travel agent by phone? My hold expires in 24 hours
@AmericanAir Thanks, but that results in missing the conference I'm attending. Are there options to book earlier,or if not,receive a refund?
@AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight due to "weather" when others are flying out just fine.  No compensation, no resolution.  Incompetent.
@AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.
@AmericanAir I need to be back in Cleveland as early as possible tomorrow
@AmericanAir worst experience ever. @VirginAmerica all the way!
@AmericanAir calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution
@AmericanAir I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take "18 hours" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is "the best we can"
@AmericanAir thanks to Jacqueline in CLT for cleaning up @amexserve and @USAirways mess!!! Awesome service
@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
@AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can't get through to anyone.
@AmericanAir - trying to track down backs for two of my attendees #help
@AmericanAir I've witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. #rude
@AmericanAir how comes no one has answered my calls or emails?
@AmericanAir at LAX and your service reps just hand out the 800 number to call. So that's not helpful.
@AmericanAir Extend rtn flight to bereavement, 22nd I could have change fee dropped, now told no.Worse day of my life #badcustomerservice
@AmericanAir I've tried ten times now last night and this morning...how many times should I try? Have meetings to make tonight in ATX.
@AmericanAir does that mean my ktn is not in my reservation?
@AmericanAir thanks for responding ... will do!
@AmericanAir Thanks that was done, I just don't understand why those whose bags couldn't fit aren't notified in air/at landing #technology
@AmericanAir  I have still not talked to anyone. You guys should be prepared for these situations. How is this good service? I am so mad!!!
@AmericanAir ok thank you. What if I can't get a hold of someone to get a new flight?
@AmericanAir #horriblecustomerservice # rudestaff # incompetentmanagers
@AmericanAir I just sent a DM
@AmericanAir @Eleonora7 good luck I've been waiting a week
@AmericanAir tisk tisk. Rude flight attendants yet again. I can't hang my suit up because I didn't buy first class? @Delta when will I learn
@AmericanAir that would be appreciated. Just please don't send me to the same page with long form &amp; limited characters.
Direct email?
@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke of #customerservice I've ever seen from a  ‚úàÔ∏è brand http://t.co/XHSUUpHeZe
@AmericanAir it would be awfully nice if you could send an alert when my flight is Cancelled Flighted. No text, no email, no love...
@AmericanAir Thanks. Took care of it. Issue was IVR was unclear and took too long to get a call-back option. Would love to see that fixed.
@AmericanAir thank you so much that helps a lot.
@AmericanAir I understand that, but I'm not even being put on hold - it says "try again Late Flightr, goodbye".
@AmericanAir I do not need an apology. I need you to fix it in a competent manner.
@AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
@AmericanAir I need to be back home tomorrow and no one is helping me. Please help me rebook for a flight tomorrow!
@AmericanAir Filed a PIR with an agent at Indianapolis airport. Unable to pull up information online on your site. Have DMed details.
@AmericanAir I hear #Delta is offering 2,500 miles to frequent flyers if their bags doesn't come out within 20 minutes of landing thoughts?
@AmericanAir But you called me - and hung up.
@AmericanAir thank you!
@AmericanAir Or u cud answer my ? here! 140 is plenty. Inflight stealing going on right now &amp; FA won't have the uncomfortable convo w pass.
@AmericanAir Fine. Would you have them call me? I left a message, was told it would be 2 hours for a call. Haven't heard anything yet.
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday early afternoon, so why did you call me at 1230am and 230am to wake me up and tell me?!
@AmericanAir in miami and the  agents Rachel Wong and Marisol Pimentel were very  pleasant in a world of chaos a BIG .thank u
@AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me?
@AmericanAir is there anyone online that can help... the flight leaves in 3 hrs
@AmericanAir why Cancelled Flight #1605 on 6/25 &amp; 6/28? Flights now 4 hrs longer &amp;  have layovers. Too Late Flight to find a reasonably priced alternative.
@AmericanAir I don't know who that may be. I was also working from home. Thanks for nothing.
@AmericanAir I called the EP line and 4 hours Late Flightr I was called back.  I sat on hold for over a hour to US Airways and then cut off
@AmericanAir my flight 1106 was Cancelled Flightled and I need to get back to Cleveland. What are my options?
@AmericanAir is there any way you could put me up in a hotel for the night?? If not I'm having to sleep at the airport again tonight.
@AmericanAir @MallowFairy And how many times, exactly, should we call and leave our number for a call back? Because that hasn't worked.
.@AmericanAir @C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I've been trying since last night to get through.
@AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers "we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai" and then hanging up is not the best practice.
@AmericanAir But when becomes about get money from the passengers are very strict but don't have ANY feedback as a reward
@AmericanAir Not even on the bag status...will take actions against this company is incredible how irresponsible are with the costumer
@AmericanAir Still waiting news about my bags 48hrs already happened and this company don't give to the passengers any certain information
@AmericanAir Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt!
@AmericanAir Phone just disconnects if you stay on the line. Need to checkout of hotel in 2 hrs &amp; have no place to go. Can't keep calling.
@AmericanAir do you know if there is wifi on this flight? If so how much is it? Thank you :-)
@AmericanAir no apologies required. I made it home safe thanks to you! Kudos to AA!
@AmericanAir requested a call back at 1am. My Cancelled Flighted flight through DFW shouldn't take this long to reroute. You're Customer Service lacks
@AmericanAir will you review your systems re notification? The website and telephone systems you have in place are clearly inadequate.
@AmericanAir Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying.
@AmericanAir Will 2396 be Cancelled Flightled tonight?
@AmericanAir Not good enough. No info communicated at any point - just silence. for hours as we sat. Oh, and then seat was broken. #worst
@AmericanAir I can't get an operator after an hour's worth of calls to Cancelled Flight a delayed flight. Automated system doesn't go beyond message.
@AmericanAir cannot provide us alternative flight until 36 hours Late Flightr ruining our trip! #Cancelled Flightled #angry #problems #ruined.
@AmericanAir Why did I have to stand at baggage claim for an hour waiting for a bag that you knew never made it on to the plane?
@AmericanAir I love travel with yours planes, all people is very nice, it's amazing! Can you please follow me back? üòãI love the company!
@AmericanAir Not very helpful if my flight is already Cancelled Flightled! What about reFlight Booking Problems? AA has my email and cell - yet no notifications.
@AmericanAir @derekc21 , I leave Jaipur tomorrow , back to Dehli , Only in Delhi  one night .  we need to  use our abilities to make magic .

@AmericanAir My flight 1108 was Cancelled Flightled. I need to be rebooked, and I can't do it online and they aren't answering calls. Help!

@AmericanAir would also like say kind move on adding the points !
@AmericanAir ok, I just received an email with my registration from your team. Thanks a lot
@AmericanAir wasn't just a delay. Your counter wouldn't take a valid CAC card as a valid ID which is needed for a TSA precheck on pass
@AmericanAir all right, but can you give me an email to write to ?
@AmericanAir is DFW accepting any arrivals or departures today?
@AmericanAir Is it true, as FAs are saying, that you have no way to collect money from passengers (after door closing) who want a MCE seat?
@AmericanAir I called reservation at 1 am and I'm still waiting for someone to call me back
@AmericanAir a confirmed flight. I'm so done! Thanks for nothing!
@AmericanAir Not necessary.  I am confident the excellent in-flight staff will make the appropriate report.
@AmericanAir Sorry, what equipment? Have the passengers been allowed to return to the plane?
@AmericanAir thank you for doing the best you could to get me rebooked. Agent on phone &amp; addtl resolution on DM was very much appreciated.

@AmericanAir  help. Flight to Dallas was Cancelled Flightled this morning from cle. on hold for  3 hours. Need to be booked on next flight out.

@AmericanAir my flight 129 to dallas and 259 to SFO has been Cancelled Flighted and they can't get me on anything else until tomorrow. You won't put
@AmericanAir How is it possible that your call system can refuse callers for over twelve hours? What service options does that leave?
@AmericanAir I understand a bit of a wait, but I called at 6:23 pm and didn't get a call back until just after 11:00 pm, that's not cool
@AmericanAir  @SouthwestAir  ‚Äî Y'all will like this one. http://t.co/hF8aJZ4ffl

@AmericanAir @Active_Aly thx. We have already been on the iberia website, and seat reservation is unavailable. Hopefully we can call them.
@AmericanAir this merger with @USAirways @usairwis a cluster of inefficiency and misinformation.  When is it going to be done?
.@AmericanAir @Kaha58 Would be nice if you could actually talk to the reserv. team...it just hangs up on you and has been since last night.
@AmericanAir why is there only one checkpoint open at JFK terminal 8? Ridiculous.
@AmericanAir wow. Flight crew shows up :15 mins before the flight. No catering for AA3390. Nice. Why to treat your customers.
@AmericanAir.If I miss saying goodbye to my friend cause of your crappy service I swear you will never hear the end of it.#AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir .. UMM hello?
@AmericanAir QSVGRU when would the next flight arrive?
@AmericanAir that is absolutely false stmt.  You have a comedy of errors incl no catering etc #GetYourActTogether

@AmericanAir. For two days now I have been trying to reach #AmericanAirlines customer service to change my flight.
@AmericanAir . Death of a dear friend has me heart broken but #AmericanAirlines has me heated!
@AmericanAir spent hour+ trying to check after to use military ID for luggage then messed up boarding pass &amp; forced into line again.
@AmericanAir has no customer service via phone or in person. Just a stone wall with a giant middle finger painted on it.
@AmericanAir 3days and no call,bag or anyone to pick up my call. Held on ph til 130 am and holding again now. Insane,#help
@AmericanAir way to ruin a vacation, my brother has called all night and had multiple places in line only to get dead air on call back
@AmericanAir trying to change my flight and you just hang up on ppl bc call volume is high. That's a joke, right?
@AmericanAir thanks for reFlight Booking Problems me on a flight and then leaving my luggage in NYC. Unbelievable.
@AmericanAir thank you!
@AmericanAir I Love American Airlines :D
@AmericanAir how about a reservation phone system that actually works? You know the 800 number is unreachable? Callbacks are "dead air".
@AmericanAir , I was told my flights 2516 &amp; 2244 was Cancelled Flightled. But I don't seem to have any date/time changes. I've been waiting for a call
@AmericanAir v nice of you to give me a breakfast voucher for $7 in an airport. That almost got me a whole drink!!
@AmericanAir husband &amp; I complain about same flight. He gets voucher, I get nothing. Because he flew biz!? Who do I email about this?
@AmericanAir no date on when revieving our money sent a letter in post and several emails no reply?? very frustrated

@AmericanAir not sure why we are being made to stand in line outside for plane that isn't ready to board when I could be sitting inside
@AmericanAir even when I did get through, no one knew anything about my bag. This is ridiculous, I still don't have my bag from Saturday.
@AmericanAir thank you Mr Parker for screwing over chairman preferred when we fly AA. No #firstclass option and treated like crap by staff
@AmericanAir thinks it's a good cs to get everyone through the gate for flight 4275 then we wait bc plane not ready http://t.co/rxmjWoo7Qi

@AmericanAir got call saying flight Cancelled Flightled but checked online and it isn't Cancelled Flightled. No where near bad weather. I have job interview
@AmericanAir Hello ! I cannot register for my tomorrow flight from Paris to Las Vegas "This feature is currently unavailable" appears ?
@AmericanAir When did they start to sell water @AdmiralsClub ?
@AmericanAir #worstcustservice you should have contingency plans for extra workers during bad weather. 4+ hours hold #ridiculous
@AmericanAir all I want is to know what to do regarding my connecting flights since my 1st is Cancelled Flightled. Could you be of assistance?
@AmericanAir Hi guys, can you tell me what the emergency is for #AA65 diverting to #Heathrow from Zurich-New York? Thanks, John.
@AmericanAir Please stop changing my flights for Spring Break. This is the 5th time!
@AmericanAir a school trip of 38 including myself had to sleep over in the airport and are all on different standby flights.This is not good
@AmericanAir your customer service is inferior to that of a nationalized third world nation's airline. Get it together.
@AmericanAir not only did you Cancelled Flight our flight from JFK and delay us by 29 hours, you've now lost 2 of our bags. Worst airline ever.
@AmericanAir Flight AAL65 declared state of emergency? Squawking 7700...
@AmericanAir just want to thank you guys for the 27 hour delay for flight AA106 from JFK due to staff shortage and not weather‚úàÔ∏è
@AmericanAir you delayed me for 15 hours in Chicago and still managed to lose my bag! Really not happy
@AmericanAir Your rubbish at Social Media! In the air two hours Late Flight but that's better than being Cancelled Flightled!
@AmericanAir yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.
@AmericanAir Thanks guys, you got it. I'm heading to Milan on Wednesday, so big week with the AA family :)
@AmericanAir 953 our  fligth Somthing to talk  about this?
@AmericanAir interested in possibly changing my flight to another day...need to see if there are any fees but your number is busy

@AmericanAir No I do not have them yet. Called for baggage status 5 times yesterday.
@AmericanAir thanks. They did not charge anything in the end so all is good.
@AmericanAir @USAirways wonderful FC FA on flight 2062 pre dawn!  Nice start to the day!
@AmericanAir been on hold for for over two hours. After waiting 2 hours earlier. Can't get any info on my reservation. How is that ok?
@AmericanAir @nickcunningham1 Except now there is no wait time, the phone system just hangs up on you. So continuing to hold won't help.
@AmericanAir LGA already by the time we pulled from the flight. QQBMUG. feel free to look up how many flights we've been "reticketed" on.
@AmericanAir @loganex except if you call now you'll get the same message. Trust me, I've tried.
@AmericanAir westjet and your rep won't do anything about my lost luggage- which I never even checked with westjet because it was lost in
@AmericanAir waited in the airport for two days to get home, not weather reLate Flightd. Dealt with horrible customer service. Finally switched to
@AmericanAir are you ignoring me on purpose? It was sad enough having your automated system hang up on me üò≠
@AmericanAir who do I need to talk to to get a full refund on my trip? Your call center offers no assistance.
@AmericanAir why wont you find my luggage without blaming everyone else?
@AmericanAir that all AA is for USAir Elite members. It's one big disappointment in the way we are treated. #epicfailure
@AmericanAir we have been rebooked due to weather, but need to change our reservation and fly on the 24th, instead of the 23rd.
@AmericanAir love how you can't get an agent on the phone and the automated system hangs up on you
@AmericanAir I was just called abt my flight Cancelled Flightlation- a flight that was Cancelled Flightled at 10:30a Sunday. Two 4:00a calls are not okay.
@AmericanAir Can you respond to my DM?
@AmericanAir Thank you for the worst experience ever on an airline, from me to you, I hope your embarrassed as an airline. Pathetic
@AmericanAir airport to figure this out or can someone tell me now? Flight is from San Juan to San Diego

@AmericanAir @British_Airways 2 weeks ago today i arrived in miami and I still don't have my bag, absolute disgrace!
@AmericanAir what terminal LHR for aa5/BA1506? Doesn't say in boarding pass
@AmericanAir so am I going to be homeless or do I have a place to stay tonight? Can you respond to me here so I can go back to sleep?
@AmericanAir at 5 am and have no clue if we have a place to stay or not
@AmericanAir but really, can you DM me on here to verify if you've booked a hotel for our extra night here? Kinda unsettling to get a call
@AmericanAir extra night we have to stay in San Juan now. How can I check on that?
@AmericanAir hey I got a call saying our flight was rescheduled but I can't get through to anyone to see if you're providing a hotel for the
@AmericanAir @emeyerson @ggreenwald Don't wait on a bag. Go to Walmart and get what you need for tomorrow morning.

@AmericanAir Hi. I have KOA-LAX-PHL-ORD booked as a 1-way savr awrd. If I called to chnge it to KOA-LAX-PHX-ORD would I have to pay any fees
@AmericanAir been calling 2 different offices already and still no sign of my baggage. First time on American Air.. (6)
@AmericanAir @Cowboycerrone You apologise for HIS frustrations &amp; HIS disappointment but NOT your terrible service? #BlameShiftOverload
@AmericanAir Got it worked out. Had to postpone my trip and pay extra though. :/ Not easy for a poor graduate student.
@AmericanAir How best to talk with an agent to reschedule Cancelled Flighted flight? No one answers at AA. Know it's busy, but need help.Thanks
@AmericanAir I don't want to waste any more of my time on your airline (you've already robbed 21 hours of my day) but I definitely will.
@AmericanAir me because it might not be so urgent for you but it really is for me. (5)
@AmericanAir i've now been in France two days without changing clothes and nothing to keep me warm so please locate my bag and send it to(4)
@AmericanAir flight 45 JFK-LAS. First the catering was Late Flight, the. No push back crew. 2hrs delay.
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted 2nd time. Can't reach agent to reschedule. Can you call me?
@AmericanAir my two coats were in that bag so i have been in france with no coat, walking around with a T shirt and one clean pair.(3)
@AmericanAir my bag is still in Miami and cannot be located?! How do you loose a bag like that? With a tag and everything?? (2)
@AmericanAir So i was visiting SJU and was returning to Paris and they checked my bag at the gate in SJU, i arrived in paris and nothing,(1)
@AmericanAir speaking 2 languages paid off! as the US line left me over 70 min in hold -without an answer- the latinamerican solved in 20min
@AmericanAir Yep, was in one of my other camera memory card :D
@AmericanAir is terrible, my flights Cancelled Flighted and i've been on hold for the past 4 hours. Never again.
@AmericanAir I certainly hope my LA /PBI on 25 th has a NEW plane . The seats on Feb 11 th flight ( in reverse) God awful
@AmericanAir 20 HS students from Ithaca NY stuck in Miami flts xld u won't rebook to get kids home use carrier alliance #rulesshouldbend
@AmericanAir Hands down the worst airline to travel with. Really really fucking bad.
@AmericanAir can you use the aa credit platinum select world mastercard for Alaska flights?  Or just american?
@AmericanAir Why did  AA973 return to JFK? Thanks :)
@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
@AmericanAir yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying, I'm rethinking that...
@AmericanAir still waiting on a dm response..... #sloooowresponses
@AmericanAir @robinreda that can be a stop over before Paris. You are an embarrassment
@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
@AmericanAir highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items
@AmericanAir just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.
@AmericanAir FINALLY called me back... BUT HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME.  Like the worst prank call EVER!!
@AmericanAir wait times of 2 hours to talk with an exec plt agent, what is going on!!!
@AmericanAir so the one time we upgrade to first class our luggage was open and now missing valuable items that can't be replaced. #upset
@AmericanAir please rebook me from Seattle to Columbus Tue 2/24, locator: KARAAX, name: Mitchell M Neuer

@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flighted! I'm trying to get to #chicago. What are me and @justynmoro gonna do. #flying#flight#travel
@AmericanAir working over time tonight?  Got delayed 2 days .. In SJU .. Could be worse :)

@AmericanAir has to be the worst airline in the world #yousuck #horrible #Oscars2015
@AmericanAir Reebooked for tomorrow in AA 1389 LV-DFW at 810 am arriving 12.50pm; still open this flight?

@AmericanAir I'm trying to reach the advantage department to add my number to a recent flight
@AmericanAir I am going to keep these tweets coming till AA does something...which I know is nothing..hoping I go way...not likely.
@AmericanAir make sure u insure your luggage as those assholes @ AA take no fricken responsibility...&amp; don't  believe their lies!!!!
@AmericanAir-everyone: its been weeks&amp;those dickheads @ AA hadn't contacted me...they lost my checked bag &amp; carryon and haven't offer to pay
@AmericanAir why arent callings going thru it doesnt have me wait or anything and automated stuff is messed up
@AmericanAir 235.  We made it to Seattle...
@AmericanAir we will not be flying with you or US air again. The changes and Cancelled Flightations leading up to today's big finale is unacceptable.
@AmericanAir thanks for your apology but it's a bit Late Flight. Cancelled Flighting a flight more than 24 hrs in advance due to weather is ridiculous. We
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight tomorrow (without telling me) and I want to rebook-please help me book a new flight! What # can I call?
@AmericanAir The word failure means: an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success nonperformance of something due.
@AmericanAir Why offer automated call back option when agent is available only to call me &amp; have me sit on hold? At 12:30am. #onholdfordays
@AmericanAir do you have the phone number of a supervisor i can speak to regarding my travels today
@AmericanAir - Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
@AmericanAir To think that I'm a "Priority Member"! Wonder how you treat the plebes. I know which rewards card I'm Cancelled Flightling immediately.
@AmericanAir - for the past 5.5 hours, call volume is so high that no one can take my call to Cancelled Flight my itinerary? #YoureDoingItWrong 1/2
@AmericanAir Worst airline. You Cancelled Flight flight, don't let me know, I wait on hold 30 mins, told to enter callback for middle of the night?!!
@AmericanAir  Did you guys just give up helping people? Your phone tree just hangs up on me and I have a flight tomorrow. Connection pending
@AmericanAir you called back just to put me on hold. It's midnight. Literally just want to know how I'm getting home and I'm getting no help
@AmericanAir Flight #2390 delayed 14 hours!! No one at #AmericanAirlines counter can tell my husband that he will be on that flight! Help???
@AmericanAir this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers
@AmericanAir seriously, there aren't any reps available to take phone calls? Even for platinum?
@AmericanAir overall lack of attention or foresight when managing flights.
@AmericanAir now we are all stuck on the plane after landing because crew unable to figure it out
@AmericanAir Also, been on hold for 30 minutes with your "customer service" to find out when my new flight is scheduled bc your site SUCKS
@AmericanAir Yes and without my bags. 2 first class tickets to Tahiti would be nice. Just saying
@AmericanAir Err 2 hour wait time for the Exec. Plat. line?
@AmericanAir can you please connect these two reservations together and also add a child in a lap. KEVOLT and SOZLDJ march 1. Thanks
@AmericanAir ... Do I have to even say anything?  Over 6 hours on hold... No one has ever sucked as much as you. http://t.co/NcrMqIBIWo
@AmericanAir  MY FLIGHT #2962 OUT OF CLL @ 0600 WON'T LET ME CHECK IN. PLEASE HELP. #IMPORTANTFLIGHT
@AmericanAir Your agent sent our family on 3 diff planes to dfw that were as Late Flight due to delay as the Cancelled Flighted plane that started this #fail
@AmericanAir Finally got a call from AA, but it was an automated voice that hung up on me! I called back &amp; it says it'll be 2 more hours.
@AmericanAir I've been on hold ANOTHER hour and still nothing. My Cancelled Flighted flight was supposed to be six hours from now. #Stranded
@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?
@AmericanAir I am running out of battery you have my chargers,clothes,coat,contact lenses, need to be in mtg tom need help #pathetic service
@AmericanAir Flight 4606 from MEM to DCA delayed 6 hours! Now holding breath while they keep me trapped 3 hours to de-ice. #scareair
@AmericanAir stuck in airplane both on way out of PHL and again in Houston. All passengers frustrated. Makes me want to avoid airline
@AmericanAir bag turned up, no thanks to your useless call-centre and useless website
@AmericanAir flight from PHL to Austin Cancelled Flighted, headed to Houston, delayed, now have to pay to rent a car and drive 3 hrs to Austin
@AmericanAir I understand the weather issues. I don't understand how I was not notified of the Cancelled Flightlation, and had to realize it so Late Flight.
@AmericanAir why won't u deliver my luggage? Almost two days and holding on the phone for over 4 hrs. Help!
@AmericanAir - Whoooo Hooooo just crossed 25,367!!! At my current pace I should reach 152,202 for the year.
@AmericanAir would like to talk to someone, please follow.
@AmericanAir  you have now lost my luggage for40 hours holding for4 hrs on phone #wtf is this how you treat your loyal passengers?#stranded
@AmericanAir @Nashinmypants lmao this is so funny
@AmericanAir have been waiting over THREE hours to talk to someone to rebook a flight due to weather. does call back service actually work??
@AmericanAir the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating
@AmericanAir I was on a flight for tomorrow and my reservation is coming up.  Help me!
@AmericanAir please DM me a way to get in touch with someone that can help. I'm platinum AA and considering quitting AA BC of this.
@AmericanAir thanks for following up. I think it's fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars I had to buy.
@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
@AmericanAir Understood. Thanks anyway
@AmericanAir so what are you going to do for me since I can't take the option you gave me. What type of refund will you do for me?
@AmericanAir 1) I was on 1610 today to YYZ. I had a bit of a bag issue that was cleared up beautifully. Thank you to all of the check in
@AmericanAir sounding like they just got bitch-slapped by @juliasinton948
@AmericanAir when will tomorrow's flight Cancelled Flightlations at Dfw for AA flights be posted? We are on 2424 at 7am from LAX!
@AmericanAir gate agent Jan L at Phoenix was at least able to get my younger daughter seated near my wife. Thank you!
@AmericanAir I've been on hold with international award reservations for almost 2 hours. 800-433-7300 keeps calling me. what is going on?
@AmericanAir can someone actually either call back or help me figure out how I'm getting home??!
@AmericanAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
@AmericanAir can I get home before 12 or no?
@AmericanAir I left something on my flight from ORD to SFO earlier today and believe it's on the plane back at ORD now. Please help.
@AmericanAir How is hanging up on customers because of "high volume" customer service? Tried to resolve via DM-still waiting.So bad. #aafail
@AmericanAir  I was told it would be emailed to me, but I haven't received anything yet. How can I follow-up?
@AmericanAir all good! I'm catching the 11:10p flight tonight. Thanks for the response.
@AmericanAir that's interesting-Agent told me so. Sadly, another booked passenger didn't make it to gate by push back so I made it on.
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, website refers to 1-800#, the 1-800# hangs up on me. Not auto-rebooked. Really? Horrible company.
@AmericanAir booked AA3370 departing JFK 2/25/15. It was booked via BA and I want to change my FF# to AA can you do that for me via Twitter?
@AmericanAir We have been sitting on this bird #AA1457 for 2 hrs on the dfw tarmac.  Some water would be nice.  Where's your manners?
@AmericanAir I need to know what to do? My flight has been Cancelled Flightled and I can't speak to anyone. Help!
@americanair been calling your for 4+ hours to reschedule a flight to #DFW due to weather and your won't even let me stay on hold.....
@AmericanAir Thanks, she did her best. Staying the night in Dallas, new trial to Detroit via Atlanta tomorrow, assuming no Cancelled Flightlations.
@AmericanAir your customer service is a disgrace.
@AmericanAir Joanna did a WONDERFUL job!  Thank her for me?
@AmericanAir She got to the gate just in time to watch the plane push back. 5 minutes was all she needed. Glad we‚Äôve relatives nearby.
@AmericanAir first flight is Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold for 4 hours. Need information and getting none. Help?
@AmericanAir Get a new crystal ball. Cancelled Flight flights before weather hits to rebook me on flight during? Looking like 2 nights hotel on me.
@AmericanAir yes. Shows Cancelled Flightled &amp; asks for her to contact you at 800 number.
@AmericanAir Thanks! Are they really open 3.30 am - 7 pm every day? Any way to check they are open before going all the way there? Thanks.
@AmericanAir Toby hates you lol
@AmericanAir Thanx for replying. DM sent
@AmericanAir what I am put off by is the fact that no gate supervisor has tried to come by and communicate with us.
@AmericanAir not anymore.
@AmericanAir Need to change flight, but the CS # is telling me it can't take my call. Can't change online. Please help. Flight is this week.
@AmericanAir 48 hours and still no bag. Could have flown to Costa Rica and back by now. I had gifts for my family in my bags.
@AmericanAir No, when I call AA now I can't even get on hold...can you help me?
@AmericanAir lies,lies,lies.  Worst travel experience of my life. Day 2 no clothes on vaca.  #lostluggage #unprofessional #pit #mia
@AmericanAir @ArminRosen @ggreenwald Tell that piece of shit to get fucked... I'll fly exclusively with you for life...
@AmericanAir I have "continued contacting" your phone reps for 7 hours and am still unable to get through. That's absurd and I am livid.
@AmericanAir thanks
@AmericanAir probably had money on @BensonHenderson they said to hell with @Cowboycerrone lol
@AmericanAir DFW GATE 16 to BMI agent seriously is beyond incompetent.  Never flying AA again if can be avoided #fail #pathetic
@AmericanAir I'm going to speak with customer service at the airport tomorrow morning and see what my options are. I need a flight tomorrow
@AmericanAir can we get a status update on flight 1457? Are we going to make it home tonight...?
@AmericanAir üôè in my hotel now. Thank you!
@AmericanAir I have almost 3 million miles w u so I am loyal to u.  When r u going to reciprocate?  What a joke
@AmericanAir Thank you for holding, we apologize for the delay in answering your call. To speak to a representative please continue to hold.
@AmericanAir Weather was not involved.
@AmericanAir @dogbuckeye No, I was on hold for 4 1/2 hours.  3 diff agents each w/ different information, frustrating, kept getting txfd...
@AmericanAir I'm still on hold if you're wondering...  4 hours 37 minutes and counting.  #ServiceFail #OnHoldForever #Suboptimal
@AmericanAir I have never seen such incompetency from a gate agent in years of business travel DFW B16 gate agent needs training or new job
@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 it says changes can't be made online
@AmericanAir what's the status of flights for Tuesday out of Dallas??
@AmericanAir Hey you Cancelled Flightled my flight, and I can't get someone on the phone to rebook (2 hour wait minimum). Can I get some service?
@AmericanAir our ft 1261 TUS/DFW (w/cx to LGA) tomorrow Cancelled Flighted,  4 hrs so far waiting for call back. What should we do? Need to get to nyc
@AmericanAir @USAirways and our meals are also on us, because this company does not care about their #customers. Truly disgraceful.
@AmericanAir by far the best example of the worst company @Cowboycerrone
@AmericanAir @USAirways cost me a day of vacation ($350 hotel stay), day of dog boarding, and a day of airport parking.
@AmericanAir Got my bags this morning! Thanks!
@AmericanAir Joanna is wonderful, new flight booked by a very friendly and helpful agent during a very stressful day! Thank You!
@AmericanAir @USAirways and the way I have been spoken to by #DFW and #Mia employees is truly disgusting. Save the pain fly with anyone else
@AmericanAir I'm home &amp; only 9hr Late Flight.  No thanks to your service centre - their plan involved 4 flight legs all across NA and 2 full days..
@AmericanAir thx for losing my bag. How hard is it to care for a bag w PRIORITY on it?why do u cont to not care for EP's?
@AmericanAir ok no worries. Thanks for the straight story. It's appreciated.
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response.  When I book I've tried my AA number and my US Airways number and each time it doesn't pick it up
@AmericanAir to my destination. After waiting 2 hours and missing our second flight with them. Our #luggage made the flight though...
@AmericanAir flights out of Dallas on Tuesday are not going to be Cancelled Flightled correct?
@AmericanAir that luggage you forgot...#mia.....he just won an oscarüòÑüíùüíùüíù
@AmericanAir cost me 1 day of #vacation ($350) and all I got was a rude woman tell me to go to another country and figure out how to get...
@AmericanAir You should really help @Cowboycerrone out, you are getting a TON of bad publicity right now #WillNeverFlyWithYou
@AmericanAir flight number #2386
@AmericanAir it looks like a mistake
@AmericanAir lost @LeslieWolfson luggage on flight yesterday morning #Miami to #NewYork #LGA no response and no luggage more than 37 hrs ltr
@AmericanAir wow that's helpful.
@AmericanAir at the gate when I get off the plane?
@AmericanAir can you take care @Cowboycerrone please.  Thanks
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @nlrphoto Those are very beautiful photos!‚Äù Thx! Would marketing dept be interested in buying?
@AmericanAir no worries you're swamped I know just dmd back THANK U
@AmericanAir we made it so no worries... You guys did good tonight and even put @ESPN_CoachMack on my flight #firstclass
@AmericanAir By "answering as fast as they can", you mean hanging up on every call?
@AmericanAir but at least your automated message gives me info about your merger w/ @USAirways. Another airline I know to avoid.
@AmericanAir done. I hope you can offer something.
@AmericanAir that 2 hr wait became a 4 hr one. And y'all claimed to have sent an email. Yeah, that never happened. #FlyDelta
@AmericanAir it's been 2 hrs of wait on the phone a) worst customer services b) trying to know where my suitcase Is and way MORE üò§#ANGRY
@AmericanAir why don't you take care of @Cowboycerrone flight screw ups
@AmericanAir wht n üëé experience w/aa reservations #service Tried to be patient with rep and she just disconnects me aa do u record conv.?
@AmericanAir Any info for Cancelled Flightled flight 1046 tomorrow morning out of DFW? Can't get calls through to speak with anyone.
@AmericanAir ticks me off.
@AmericanAir  my fly is 1579  if do you have some news
‚Äú@AmericanAir Thanks for info on super large passengers- the extra seat Mr. Big needed was the one i was sitting in already #customerservice
@AmericanAir today, after 6 yrs., no longer my preferred airline.
@AmericanAir Thanks. Two hours to go inflight, then hotel.  Hang in there with all the DFW travel delays AA team.
@AmericanAir - Appreciate your system is busy but when I call, having your automated system hang up on me is not helpful.
@AmericanAir next time my flight's Cancelled Flightled, I'd appreciate SOME indication (email, text, carrier pigeon). App didn't even warn at check in
@AmericanAir Nope, I have not been rebooked.
@AmericanAir online flight notification is down.
@AmericanAir - I am Platinum.  I am flying USAir and they have stranded me in CLT.  Not answering phones. Did not rebook me.  Please help?
@AmericanAir is AA951 to S√£o Paulo taking off today? Your colleagues won't tell us any thing
@AmericanAir flight 1388 tomorrow 5:15 am, status please, thanks
@AmericanAir you can't change my flights and not have enough operators to handle calls.... #unacceptable #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir You have a lot on your pLate Flight dealing with Cancelled Flightlations and weather tonite. Those are more important. I know you will respond.
.@AmericanAir Flight 654 Delayed / Flight 409 You sold my seat / flight 0671 strand me in PHX for three hours. Thanks for the memories üò°üò§üòñüò≤üò©
@AmericanAir I paid extra $ for my seat &amp; the monitor didn't work from on AA111. How about a refund on the seat? Conf #: MDBEEI, McMullen
@AmericanAir how nice it would be if you had helpful flight attendants instead of the rude nasty ones you employ. #WhyAreYouYelling
@AmericanAir Yes. However, the seats they assign us that day are never together. I just want to sit with my husband! Why is that impossible?
@AmericanAir any luck?
@AmericanAir Group Cancelled Flights close to a thousand #flights Monday http://t.co/v1RADYKEP2
@AmericanAir it's been almost 3 days and it's still frozen. Thanks doll üòòüòë
@americanair line of 100+ people to rebook at MIA now. Virtual hold on rebook line just hangs up during call back. http://t.co/Upaz1eF3Dl
@AmericanAir found out my flight tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled &amp; got in the queue for a callback 3.5 hours ago‚Ä¶still nothing. Can I get rebooked??
@AmericanAir looking for status of flight 1388 schedule for 5:15 am tomorrow morning, thank you
@AmericanAir Thanks for your canned response that makes it look like you care about your customers. I'm sure all Twitter users fall for it..
@AmericanAir Yes, but should be able to get a push notification via the app if I‚Äôm logged in and on a trip. Email/text is so 2010 üò•.
@AmericanAir @Cowboycerrone  ratchet airway!. ......
@AmericanAir How do I check? Reservation for Joe Watson and Kelsey Jennings. We were on hold for 2 hours. Waiting for call back now. ETA?
@AmericanAir is the new @SpiritAirlines, and both are worse than taking the @GreyhoundBus #americanairlines #nocustomerservice #fail
@AmericanAir My flight tomorrow from SLC to DFW AA304 Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me get there?
@AmericanAir what are the odds my bag was picked up by someone not me while in another country? Because it says it hasn't been located yet.
@AmericanAir better do the right thing and take care of @Cowboycerrone or els you're losing business!!!!
@AmericanAir have been waiting for a call back for over two hours jan to die tomorrow at 6am Cancelled Flightled what are my options?
@AmericanAir I already landed! But, if you still care it was 1891. Thanks for the help though!, do you k ow what caused the failure?
@AmericanAir one staff on desk. Now been queuing for over an hr.
@AmericanAir anything you can do?
@AmericanAir and even worse, by the time you responded to my tweets I took two flights over five hours. And that was the quickest response!
@AmericanAir on top of that my online record was unavailable as well and then couldn't get anyone on the phone.
@AmericanAir My ex-boyfriend picks up my calls more than you do! #Cancelled Flightedflight #nocustomerservice #americanairlines #FAIL
@AmericanAir Hey AA, a suggestion: Note on your seat maps what seats have electronics box blocking legroom. AA215 http://t.co/hcNN0wXQQr
@AmericanAir why are you still selling tickets when you haven't rebooked people to arrive at their destinations on time?
@AmericanAir Didn't really need anything. Saw your mentions are often negative. Keep up the good work. #gratitude  üá∫üá∏‚úàÔ∏è
@AmericanAir #AmericanView Sweet Home Chicago http://t.co/J6icLV8DTs
@AmericanAir LTALJX, from DCA to OMA this morning. All of the staff that helped me fix my problem were so helpful. #goodthingscome #thanks
@AmericanAir @ti2469 oh shiz i'm only 40 minutes into my wait after the first 3 hour barrier ...unbelievable
@AmericanAir wow @AmericanAir still screw n stuff up
@AmericanAir I just checked the app and it said my flight had been moved back a day? No explanations why. No answer on the 800 number.
@AmericanAir employees are racist!!!!!
@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, "not yet located"?
@AmericanAir i hope it takes you 6 hours to get home when it should take 20. my flight was Cancelled Flightled because they "couldn't staff the plane"
@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
@AmericanAir not yet. I'm next in the terminal a customer service area.
@AmericanAir and it gets better...other passengers rebooked direct on other airlines. #whereisthelove 
#whybeAAFF?
@AmericanAir I need to speak to a REAL PERSON. My flight was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation, and I've been on hold for more than 3 hours.
@AmericanAir you have let me down. Seriously. #unhappycustomer
@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?
@AmericanAir why do I have to wait for 2 hours to talk to someone when you changed my flight?
@AmericanAir due to gate agents I missed my connecting flight to Mexico City...not a happy customer AA- let's correct this
@AmericanAir she doesn't have Twitter.
@AmericanAir at some point u need to tell passengers what is going on. At Jfk waiting to get on flight it is a mess.
@AmericanAir its not that, it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer
@AmericanAir seriously, I do not want to wait 24 hours for a flight when I have to prepare for a family funeral.
@AmericanAir your gate agents at DFW gate B16 are pathetic tonight.  Terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic
@AmericanAir I was worried when my bag went SAN to DCA 24 hours before me. But our reunion was an organized  breeze! http://t.co/uOARyQ98PU
@AmericanAir yea no worries. I'm just going home to Denver. Not your fault, weather sucks bad.
@AmericanAir I've been tryin to use my voucher to book a flight the last 2days. Lines are busy. Plse help me?The flight may go up.
@AmericanAir Yes, thanks for checking. Very cramped, but got on &amp; made it safely. Flying back tomorrow at 1pm. http://t.co/CSddCCMvbD
@AmericanAir  is the worst airline to ever travel with!!!! The worst!! They're equivalent to DIRT!!!!!!
@AmericanAir great flight experience again... SFO-JFK... Dare I say it? A consistent high quality on a legacy airline? Keep it up guys!
@AmericanAir pretty bad at #DFW no updates two flights behind doors open breeze no America airlines workers http://t.co/6MBK79mdnW
@AmericanAir Great - thank you.
@AmericanAir yes and the auto rebook confirmed an outbound that departs after the return flight.  # fire the software programmers
@AmericanAir I'm getting calls from 1-800-433-7300 but the calls seem to drop instantly. Is there any alternate avenue for resched. support?
@AmericanAir Supposed to arrive at my destination tonight. American rebooks me for Wednesday? Where am I staying until then?
@AmericanAir @USAirways how can you have no food on a 4 hour flight 528 from Columbus to Phoenix? Starving and Pissed off. Can't eat Go Go!
@AmericanAir jal and cathay pacific so no, I can't do it online.
@AmericanAir what is the status of flight 1675 tomorrow
@AmericanAir 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
@AmericanAir The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.
@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
@AmericanAir Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
@AmericanAir 37 minutes??????
@AmericanAir  having trouble getting rebooked
@AmericanAir I understand. I'm feeling cranky. I called AA's bag tracker number and heard "your bag has not been located." üò©
@AmericanAir AA45 ... JFK to LAS.
@AmericanAir I'm willing to hold for an agent. you aren't being helpful you keep hanging up on me #americanairsucks #hiremorepoeple
@AmericanAir I have been trying to speak with an agent the whole day about my Cancelled Flightled flight, what I can do?
@AmericanAir Need to go frm TPA to MCI tmrw &amp; my connection thru DFW is Cancelled Flightled. Can u connect me thru a diff city? Been on hold for 2 hrs
@americanair Any hints to get through to and stay connected with you to rearrange weather reLate Flightd Cancelled Flights? Hours in now w/nothing.
@AmericanAir no gate agent after 30 minutes to let us off the plane???? WTW / grounds crew is here / hope you're ready to cover my delay
@AmericanAir You can't even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media.
‚Äú@AmericanAir:  "Jason, you'll end up missing your connection. Please see our DFW agents for assistance.‚Äù Nope! Hasn't taken off yet, still!
@AmericanAir finally made it to chicago - 13 hours Late Flight.  Did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. Never again. Good bye.
@AmericanAir instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
@AmericanAir guys 5350 in dfw  stuck at the gate for half an hour.  Do we pull the slide or what?
@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
@AmericanAir after all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business
@AmericanAir Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
@americanair I finally got someone on the phone so no worries!
@AmericanAir it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn't a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
@AmericanAir ok. Pilots are looking for agents  - they jumped out / FLT 5350 #DFW / this is crazy
@AmericanAir no you're not you're trying to book me PAST when i need 2 arrive but you're still selling seats on the day I'm trying 2 travel
@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service
@AmericanAir Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of DFW today/tomorrow?
@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying "what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving
@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
@AmericanAir Your logo looks like 3D glasses.
@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
@AmericanAir and let FLT 2350 know I'm coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW
@AmericanAir you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.
@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.
@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
@AmericanAir yeah, rebooked for tomorrow morning. But extremely disappointed to miss a wedding.
@AmericanAir #americanview New paint scheme looks great! #usairways http://t.co/Gt6umHbh43
@AmericanAir thanks for the call on my Cancelled Flightled flight, NOT!  Flight Booking Problems me for Tues no good weather caused me 2 leave early
@AmericanAir on plane for JFK-&gt;SFO, been sitting here for 1.5 hours waiting for push crew, how is this acceptable?
@AmericanAir waiting for you to pick up... Coming up on 3 hours now... http://t.co/nOPq5xIsbS
@AmericanAir hey flight 5350 in dfw stuck at gate with no gate agent.  Plane full of people missing connections.
@AmericanAir so we've now been driving across DFW for over 90mins. That's half fucking way to Texarkana! #shouldhavedriven
@AmericanAir can you tell me why all flights from XNA 2 DFW are Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow morning already?
@AmericanAir thank you for the update!
@AmericanAir pathetic service
@AmericanAir Dallas/Fort Worth flight number 5320
@AmericanAir oh it can get better apparently. After making us wait for a gate, psych!! Now we need you to de-ice before coming to the gate!!
@AmericanAir if you could get the gate crew to help us off FLT 5350 that would be great....
@AmericanAir is the situation at JFK this evening is going to get better or worse ? Do not Cancelled Flight a flight like yesterday after 8h delayed
@AmericanAir ya but u weren't sitting on the plane.
@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
@AmericanAir I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won't pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad
@AmericanAir yes. He's in the next flight
@AmericanAir several hrs Late Flight and 140 characters won't do it. Cheers though
@AmericanAir my wife's flight is Cancelled Flightled, told to call. No one answers. How do we book a flight? Help us please
@AmericanAir not in any way that I am happy with or find acceptable.   If I could speak to a human maybe that would happen
@AmericanAir hi my flight to DFW 2463 was Cancelled Flightled tonight. Called in and left my number for call back it's been 3hrs please help.
@AmericanAir Hi, I have my name, email, and AAdvantage #, but website won't let me reset password. Can we troubleshoot together? Thanks!
@AmericanAir Still looking as we speak.
@AmericanAir we're on AA1401 landed at 8:55pm in Miami, but waiting for a gate. Can someone on your team help us out?!
@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???
@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer
@AmericanAir you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can't do it online #yourphonesystemsucks
@AmericanAir Shout-out to all the ground crews working in the cold! Thanks for what y'all do. (&amp; social media team for customer service)
@AmericanAir I fortunately was not on that flight - just in the same waiting area / impressed w how he handled the stressful situation
@AmericanAir we've been on hold for over 4 hrs, you Cancelled Flighted flt 2222 phl-dfw. Need assistance!!!
@AmericanAir thanks to Marie for reFlight Booking Problems me and my friends!!! I'm Cali bound thanks to this sweet angel! #blessed
@AmericanAir their flights into Buffalo as well -- You were the only flight Cancelled Flightled!!!
@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of "weather" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled
@AmericanAir know that I could use that for a flight into Canada.  By they time they figured it out, it was too Late Flight to check our bags
@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
@AmericanAir its Adolfo Garcia
@AmericanAir My friend needs some help on her flt (she's not on Twiiter), can I DM you her info?
@AmericanAir my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been Cancelled Flighted, what should i do?
@AmericanAir hats off to Admiral Lounge attendant @ YYZ Terminal 3 who gave her banana to our toddler when none avail elsewhere.
@AmericanAir "We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight" is ridiculous.
@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?
@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!
@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
@AmericanAir  A true #AmericanView ...The National Mall http://t.co/N7ExdbcRHg
@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny
@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
@AmericanAir I know you are getting pummeled tonight @dfwairport we were one of the lucky out of @slcairport just one more @AUStinAirport
@AmericanAir And gold status too.
@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?
@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
@AmericanAir I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks
@AmericanAir I'm on #1058 tmrw from CUN DFW. Final dest'n is ORD. Seeing freezing rain in DFW all morning. Should I change my connection?
@AmericanAir no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg
@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
@AmericanAir I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.
@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
@AmericanAir you set a schedule try and keep it !!! #AAALWAYSLate Flight
@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?
@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?
@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply, but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly, tho.
Thank you for sending more details  @AmericanAir: They're pretty handy dandy. more info here: http://t.co/FvlxIRh1F1 #LookforwardtoflywithAA
@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the "we'll call you when someone is free" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up.
@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time
@AmericanAir what do kids aged 11 and 12 need to fly with AA internally within the usa. Thanks for confirming
@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault.
@AmericanAir Please help AA 2258 Monday Cancelled Flightled.  Can you advise on reFlight Booking Problems / refund.  Have children and need to make plans now
@AmericanAir DM sent. Answer me please
@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane üò¢üòïüò¶ #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.
@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
@AmericanAir American Airlines.
@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
@AmericanAir I just DMed you
@AmericanAir why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ?
@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!
@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting
@AmericanAir Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!
@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful üò≥
@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF
@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks.
@AmericanAir just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams.
@AmericanAir Flight 1512 (N924AN) departs @FlyTPA enroute to @dfwairport http://t.co/j0mhMkDiVl
@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight.
@AmericanAir checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying
@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ
@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks.
@AmericanAir my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can't get an agent. They've called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help?
@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y‚Äôall hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
@AmericanAir Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket--I can't do both. Can you help?
@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you‚Äôve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight
@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy.
@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick "Goodbye" Very Sad!
@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
@AmericanAir I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?
@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
@AmericanAir yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though üòí I'm really mad about the situation
@AmericanAir whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won't stray anymore. I'm talking about you @Delta!
@AmericanAir @praywinn between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer...
@AmericanAir I need help with a reservation purchased on @AmericanAir but operated on @USAirways, can't get through on the 800#
@AmericanAir  flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled.  What do I do next?  Pls advise.  #HELP
@AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!
@AmericanAir my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund?
@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
@AmericanAir "overweight" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is.
@AmericanAir @jaynegelman How,about more@Blacklist too!!
@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled.
@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
@AmericanAir I ended up on a flight to LA my fourth time on standby. Thanks! http://t.co/NA5G5EAKPA
@AmericanAir been waiting on hold for more than an hour
@AmericanAir thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won't be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning.
@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses.
@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
@AmericanAir @HeyMyNameIsSEAN Sean if you look at the AA schedule it sometimes gives you a clue if new'airplanes are used. They are gr8
@AmericanAir thanks for the show! üëç
@AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport
@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
@AmericanAir @kconti44 This looks like JFK - had a great pic of the OneWorld jets lined up on the opposite side #Air Berlin, LAN and AA.
@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!
@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits
@AmericanAir @superyan I did hear a last call for boarding of this flight when I was at JFK a few hours ago. good luck w/flights!
@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport
@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
@AmericanAir Yo, could that be a catering truck before mine eyes?  Unmoving? http://t.co/ASW6QwUf1Z
@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
@AmericanAir Great seats on this aircraft!
Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one planeüò°
@AmericanAir Both pictures taken at the same time but which is right? #totallyconfused http://t.co/dvSLtQZKmQ
@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
@AmericanAir 901 #Miami to #Rio to participate at @RCM_Oficial representing @CisnerosMedia #yourstoryhere
@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
@AmericanAir @cyncyn661 Are you now flying 763s to Madrid from JFK or is this DFW/ORD? Huge !!
@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
@AmericanAir who's your pick for best picture? I don't want to board your airline until I know
@AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers
@AmericanAir @PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs
@AmericanAir 8:30 departure?  Sure. Is there a catering strike at JFK?  @FoxNews @CNBC @BloombergRadio http://t.co/HPgXYZRW8o
@AmericanAir @derekc21 , so what would be a file number that works , needs to be 10 characters , email me derek.austin@century21.ca  easier
@AmericanAir @manuel_c "here for you" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or....
@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got
@AmericanAir DONE!! thank you so much!!
@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS
@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?
@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
@AmericanAir 740pm wheels up to be exact.  I'm sending a DM.
@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!
@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots
@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
@AmericanAir you wont allow calls? My husband has a ticket but it looks like all the seats are taken? I cant even call.
@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
@AmericanAir 3198 to AEX. Is it still going?
@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?
@AmericanAir Close down
@AmericanAir it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!
@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?
@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz.
@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
@AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
@AmericanAir versus @JetBlue 
in Customer Service?
Who will win!
For Me @AmericanAir is a convenience to a trip to Cali &lt;3
@AmericanAir agents refuse to help, "too busy" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO
@AmericanAir fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight?  Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck
@AmericanAir you should be contacting her for a refund - dm me and I will provide phone number
@AmericanAir ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united?
@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins
@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
@AmericanAir yep, they moved me to 16A as they showed me flying "standby"
@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?
@AmericanAir I'm on 1024 into Dallas. Do I have any chance of catching 2238 to Boston? Do I need to run from Gate D6 to A15?.
@AmericanAir AA I need a Hail Mary. How do I get from Dallas to Joplin JLN in the next 14 hours. Willing to fly to other airports and drive
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me.
@AmericanAir rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer.
@AmericanAir Hi ho, hi ho. It's off to work I go. #WeeklyCommuteOnAA http://t.co/JQHg4jTm4w
@AmericanAir you put a sour taste on this customer‚Äôs vacation. it was joke watching those ‚Äúwe care thanks for choosing us‚Äù videos
@AmericanAir are you expecting flights out of DFW to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow AM and afternoon?
@AmericanAir help us here !!! We are stuck here @jfk for more than 24hours! !we need to go home #flight919 #saveus
@AmericanAir lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr.
@AmericanAir Flight  AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #PatheticCX
@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
@AmericanAir here we go again #aa106 "Plane not ready". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed
@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded
@AmericanAir At what e-mail adress can I send your CEO Mr. Doug Parker a letter that he hopefully reads?
@AmericanAir why does your customer service line say "we are experiencing high call volume" and then spontaneously hangup on the person?
@AmericanAir well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up   try paying overtime and bring in more people
@AmericanAir What's the best way to check on any delays or Cancelled Flightlations for my flight out of DFW on Tuesday?
@americanair @bershawnjackson big UPS to Newark airport staff &amp;&amp; D.Dean. I was also treated lovely while I was in town. ‚ù§‚ù§
@AmericanAir pleaseeee find my suitcase. I want deoderant and a clean shirt for work tomorrow :(
@AmericanAir Here you go https://t.co/oM1vIEg74a

@AmericanAir ok, thanks you! Have a great night AA team!
@AmericanAir - Can you please give me a travel agent support phone number? I cant find it on your website. Thanks.
@AmericanAir any idea what's up with flight AA3181?
@AmericanAir your maint delay left us stuck in den!! Flight 1080.  Been on plane for 7 hrs.  Stop flying broke french planes!
@AmericanAir sucks!! Teco teco #reclameaqui #TripAdvisor http://t.co/auGJsCmoLu
@AmericanAir  You can't get us to Cincy but our luggage will still go there tonight? Stranded us in Dallas for 2 days w/o clothes? #Yousuck
@AmericanAir It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don't I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago?
@AmericanAir ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home
@AmericanAir we're still here guys - you are the worst
@AmericanAir 24 hours on the AirPort
@AmericanAir - don't understand why I have zero Flt info- no email- 2 he wait time on ph lines- so much for Advan Mem :(
@AmericanAir ok so why is it Late Flight? And for that matter why was my flight 4491 Cancelled Flighted this morning? I've been in YYZ since 5 AM.
@AmericanAir plane breaks, unloads the passengers, told to re enter to only come back off. Flight Cancelled Flightled, missed wedding. #badbusiness
@AmericanAir - very upset with my hometown airline. Stuck in Den Flt Cancelled Flightled. Others here with me got new Flt info
@AmericanAir absolutely worse cust. Svc ever experienced in 25 yrs of flying.  Supvrs at iah extremely rude. #poorservice #travel
@AmericanAir Kid upset, my staff upset (one accused of stealing fruit!!!!!) mistreatment due to airline policy of an Austic child.
@AmericanAir I have been trying to get through to someone about my Cancelled Flightled flight tomorrow for over 4 hours.
@AmericanAir Trip cut 7 hrs short due to flight change/massive layovers/ no peanuts or crackers/ asked for H2O and received about 2oz.
@AmericanAir Flight's Cancelled Flightled. Website says to call phone number.Phone says to check online.  How am I supposed to get some help?
@AmericanAir yes. We spent the whole day talking to agents and someone finally offered to let him stay in a hotel
@AmericanAir flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won't give luggage back. Nice.
@AmericanAir delayed for two hours at ORD--&gt;CDG the one time I need to be there to catch a train... üòí
@AmericanAir not to mention its a three hour wait to get an agent on the phone.
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted our flight and now are still delayed...NOT COOL.
@AmericanAir we did for the last 8 hours.  Your customer service is horrendous.  I should have flown Delta
@AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay
@AmericanAir why a different airport! I have no way of getting to a different airport.
@AmericanAir AA agent said I repeated myself when I was explaining. I told him "I understand English." His reply?"Our conversation is over."
@AmericanAir long wait? I literally went shopping at 3 different centers, had lunch and prepared dinner. surprise, it's winter! staff better
@AmericanAir AA 1657 was also over an hour Late Flight to depart Ohare and now we have no luggage. Not happy standing in a long line at baggage svc
@AmericanAir is flight 2934 dfw to gsp going to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow?
@AmericanAir Stuck on the plane in Charlotte.  Going to miss my connection.  No words from staff. Maybe some damn pretzels?
@AmericanAir Do you happen to know if that plane will be repainted, or fly "off into the sunset?"
@AmericanAir - AA1344 Cancelled Flighted on 2.23 - rebooked on us air 623/544 on 2.24. Has to be a nonstop on 2.24 for us (2)?
@AmericanAir today's wait was a violation of #dot #passengerbillofrights http://t.co/GxvFumn3iZ
@AmericanAir arrived in lax from ord flight AA1657 NO LUGGAGE
@AmericanAir I've got a BA flight as your airport couldn't accommodate us. We were left without any info. No vouchers for food,nothing.
@AmericanAir flight 1019 I need 2 b on the first flight out frm MIA 2 TPA. I'm extremely irritated. I've been at this airport for 5.5 hrs.
@AmericanAir many trips coming up!  I will see you soon üòÉ
@AmericanAir message and pics sent...
@AmericanAir flight 3056 in D/FW now delayed 2 hours waiting sitting in plane for baggage to be loaded - why?
@AmericanAir ‚Ä¶ Been trying to book a whole new flight since 2 hours!! what is wrong with your website?
@AmericanAir Considering it was purchased on the 21st and I attempted to use it again on the 21st I believe it would fit these parameters.
@AmericanAir pretty impressed with the in flight entertainment. Full touch, usable, smooth, good selection.
@AmericanAir Now your site is not working! WTF
@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue can you help? @SpiritAirlines is in the wrong, stuck in Florida 3days. They need to learn from real airlines.
@AmericanAir it wasn't ' disrupted' it was Cancelled Flightled. Airport agents were horrendous. Sharon was your saviour
@AmericanAir I'm great thanks keep up the good work
@AmericanAir my flight has been delayed &amp; I can't talk reach anyone in customer service because of high call volume.
@AmericanAir why does your RTW planner (spec. Circle Pacific) not let me even plan the demo routes from your website?
@AmericanAir @dfwairport listening to all the flights taking off over my house and kicking myself for Flight Booking Problems an AM flight tomorrow. Iceday?
@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue I am going to be stuck in Florida for 3 days because @SpiritAirlines wouldn't hold my connecting flight to LGA
@AmericanAir yes, I will do just that as soon as I have a moment to gather my thoughts.
@AmericanAir I even went to ticket counter and got no help
@AmericanAir Just learned my flight is Cancelled Flightled.can't get through by phone and don't see any option for assistance online. Any suggestions?
@AmericanAir Got an email about an itinerary change, but can't seem to get to anyone on phone. New flight time doesn't work for me. Help?
@AmericanAir please help my flight appears Cancelled Flight 1503 from ft. Lauderdale to Dallas to LAX. Is there anything leaving from Mia or FLL? ThxU
@AmericanAir 's computer systems are down, can't leave without a flight plan! Any ETA, American air?

@AmericanAir I want the flight I have on hold. I don't want a new flight.
@AmericanAir Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to Sabre being down. What backup plan is in place if Sabre cannot be fixed?
@AmericanAir @dfwairport got rebooked through the AA online app.
@AmericanAir please pray for us that our gear is not lost or stolen due to YOUR incompetent employees. #CNN #ABCNews #MSNBC #Photography
@AmericanAir shoutout to the agent on duty now @ Gate B1 #ABQ / outstanding customer service w delayed FLT 336 http://t.co/OoEJ4d4JoP
@AmericanAir ...is this how you want to treat your platinum (and two gold) flyers??
@AmericanAir Your gate attendants in ABQ are awful as was your service. You should be ashamed. Terrible experience here from start to finish
@AmericanAir Still sitting in airport as 6:05 flt delayed until 6:55...but still not boarding, what is happening?  No info....
@AmericanAir @sa_craig no gate agent, and only 3 PA updates for 3 hours, hinted at abandonment. horrible experience for all passengers.
@AmericanAir been a very long day in Philly...12:13pm flt to ORD Cancelled Flighted with NO notice, no message, no email.  NOT NICE FOR WE PLATINUMS.
@AmericanAir my travel for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled and then stupidly rebooked for tomorrow! I can't get through to reservations!
@AmericanAir what name and department does it come under? Thanks
@AmericanAir 1416 Cancelled Flightled? Can't get out for two days? No explanation?
@AmericanAir @sa_craig no, not helped one bit. actually ended up driving home due to extreme disorganization and lack of communication.
@AmericanAir United needs our ticket number since you rebooked us and you gave the incorrect ticket number now we can't check in #help
#nothelpful MT @AmericanAir: Our call volume is extremely high today. Our apologies. Please continue contacting Reservations for assistance.
@AmericanAir I've been trying to call to cxl a reservation for tomorrow, due to needing surgery this week - cannot get through?
@AmericanAir I can't keep dialing you guys all day. Can I get into the callback queue?
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight previous request. Will accept ticket number for document number
@AmericanAir I've called that and they said they can't help me and it's out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer
@AmericanAir 62 inches !?
@AmericanAir Thank you. Good suggestion. I checked and we were not rebooked. We'll keep checking and looking for other flights
@AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!
@AmericanAir Am on web site requesting refund for Cancelled Flightled flight. It requires numerical document number. Where get it?
@AmericanAir Hmm. Looks like you looked at my tweet from last month, not this one. Was able to get U.K. agent to help me, thanks.
@AmericanAir Stuck on a plane at JFK: food was not on the plane now we need to wait crew to push back the plane. Good job, AA!
@AmericanAir no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir while I'm aggravated - shouldn't baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped?
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @Dawn_Davis You're very welcome, Dawn. We love taking you flying. Let's do it again!‚Äù Again in 1 week!
@americanair never fails to disappoint. waiting at jfk an hour after scheduled take off and still no word on departure
@AmericanAir one of my luggage didn't made it onto my flight, hope it really gets here tomorrow, as I was told üòìüò≠
@AmericanAir lost my wife's luggage and nobody gives you and answer, all they say is go here or call there.
@AmericanAir check your dm pls
@AmericanAir why don't you have driver service to get employees to work in bad weather like hospitals etc #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on @SouthwestAir with no penalty or hoops.
@AmericanAir Thank you! You will see me :)
@AmericanAir a phone call or email when you Cancelled Flight a flight would be lovely.
@AmericanAir a guy try right...
@AmericanAir You've now put me on a BA flight - can I get access for 2 for the lounge? Been at ORD for 11.5 hrs now and still have 5 to go.
@AmericanAir flight 1081 from IAD to LAX sat for more than 3hrs because ground crew couldn't drive in snow #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir Haha I had a boarding pass for 12B, was boarding the plane and the gate agent told me to go to 41G. I'm here now. No worries.
@AmericanAir you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH?
As am I, @AmericanAir - but thankfully there was a @united lounge next door. Really not impressed by oneworld partnerships :(
@AmericanAir delayed.....wow
@AmericanAir My flt AA375 for 02/23 got cncled and i cant get hold of a CSR so i can get alternate arrangement. Plz help
@AmericanAir our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn't give them accurate ticket number now we can't check in. #annoyed
@AmericanAir You guys are totally losing me. I've been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad.
@AmericanAir @NY_NJairports AA1224: 45 mins for Priority bags to arrive, now Late Flight for evening plans! Delta 20 min bag guarantee anyone? :(
@AmericanAir sitting in a 2 hour long at least phone queue. Hoping I get things rebooked in time or at least some plastic wings. #tears
@AmericanAir it's always better to find out equipment is INOP on the ground than in the air! #safetyfirst
@AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head
@AmericanAir can I DM you info?
@AmericanAir 11 out of 11 delayed flights, you suck and getting worse
@AmericanAir Tired of sitting on a delayed #1702 again and again computer down
@AmericanAir @dotnetnate Two hour wait for EXPs as I sit on a JFK PHX flight because US computers are down. Any shot at an LAX flight?
@AmericanAir awesome! Thx
@AmericanAir @SeguineJ AA - this is a joke, right? That line isn't even accepting calls right now - they just hang up.
@AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly.
@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me
@AmericanAir even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome
@AmericanAir 2293 is the Cancelled Flightled one
@AmericanAir 1138 got us to LGA safely. Thanks for taking the time to make the plane safe before flying!
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, didn't notify me, and I can only rebook by phone, but can't get through to an agent. Epic. Fail.
@AmericanAir i was just severely upset by the rude cs rep. I get she's prob stressed, but I am too! An "aw, let me help" cld mk it btr
@AmericanAir while I'm sensitive to this fact, I don't believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way.
@AmericanAir Flight attendant #YeseniaHernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ‚úà :-)
@AmericanAir I did. 5 times. With 4 of those being hung up on. The other one it finally sent me to the call back notification. #FixYourStuff
@AmericanAir complt incompetence on flt 295.Lav delay from a pln that lnded last nite, no internet and poor svc. Not what I expect from u.
@AmericanAir Just landed - crew couldn't have been more gracious or accommodating. Although a long delay I appreciate your prompt response!
@AmericanAir why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing

@AmericanAir flights have been on time Late Flightly though!
@AmericanAir @SentieriMelinda Any updates? It shouldn't take hours for assistance. I love @SouthwestAir

@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? http://t.co/ypbkCiRBXu
@AmericanAir served me rubber pasta covered In sauce that tastes like plastic. Do you have any food for human consumption anymore ?
@AmericanAir why do #exp members have to wait "over 2 hours" to speak with an operator? Surely this is a mistake?
@AmericanAir u Cancelled Flightled my flight for tomorrow and tell me to call reservations but then refuse to take my call!!!  #not cool #hateful
@AmericanAir No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything's gr8

@AmericanAir Where are your ticket offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use voucher on website, what a headache! PLEASE HELP!
@AmericanAir I changed my own flight to tonight. Why couldn't AA do that on my behalf instead of a flight tomorrow? Poor effort all around.
@AmericanAir should be seeing this sunset from St. John usvi not philly!! http://t.co/DnDOepquKz
@AmericanAir she should not only get a refund but also an apology for the deplorable service.
@AmericanAir third you lost her bag &amp; after 50 mins of being on hold you told her she would "eventually get her bag" completely unacceptable
@AmericanAir second, she sat on the Tarmac for 3 hrs only to be told it would be 30 mins
@AmericanAir there's a direct from Miami w a seat but u rebooked niece Tuesday. Can't get through on phones? #customerservicefail

@AmericanAir first my sister had ZERO food in her cross country flight with no type of warning or voucher
@AmericanAir I need to change a ticket and my res can't be changed online.  I also can't get a call through due to high volume--can u help?
@AmericanAir rented van drove 250 miles with 6 strangers.  Arrived home 6:00am. No offers of help from AA. http://t.co/BTTGmyN0A0
@AmericanAir the ticket is a poor gesture of goodwill (for missed trip) to a top status flyer - I may not next time (AA91 LHR-ORD 2/16)
@AmericanAir @NY_NJairports Do you guys teach poor customer service or is it just part of an american dream?
@AmericanAir 3231DTW to LAG at 4:45. Flight Cancelled Flightled with no notice. Given a voucher to a dirty hotel, with no food vouchers or apology.

@AmericanAir I have been on hold 3 hours.  2 seconds of it with a rude agent.
@AmericanAir  Dear American, when did 2 hour hold times become the industry standard?  Have you heard of additional staffing during weather?
.@AmericanAir: the best the agent could do is put me on a flight arriving tomorrow afternoon, with a six hour layover.
@AmericanAir that's unacceptable. They should allow me to wait on hold, or take my number and call me themselves.
@AmericanAir RDU Customer Service is awesome. Thanks! Give em all bonuses.
@AmericanAir I let a crew member know every time this happens.  Which is most of the time.
@AmericanAir are you kidding me?  No one answering calls on reserv line due to high call volume and not even an option to wait.  Brutal

@AmericanAir @GolfWithWoody Don't buy it, Woody. They're making it MUCH worse with understaffing, rudeness, and pre-rookie mistakes
@AmericanAir you have to run the engine to troubleshoot an issue before boarding the plane!?! How about another plane? #aa2227 #miatoiah
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @RussellsWriting Russ, please contact Reservations at 800-433-7300 for reFlight Booking Problems options.‚Äù Good luck with that!

@AmericanAir when is next lax JFK flight today
@AmericanAir appreciate update. Have also appreciated our pilots effort to explain to us just now. Accurate, authoritative comms is vital.
@AmericanAir now down to only one agent helping a stagnant line of almost 100 customers. Super.
@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.
@AmericanAir after all, the plane didn‚Äôt land in identical or worse) conditions at GRK according to METARs.
@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flighted out of LAX for tomorrow due to connection in DFW. Help please? we can go out of orange or burbank
@AmericanAir first the pilot, then the catering...
.@AmericanAir Also, not the reservations team's fault. Bad top-down decision. I feel bad for the reservations AND social media teams.
@AmericanAir I would like a refund for this flight. They delayed the flight 5 times. I feel like you're making fun of us.
@AmericanAir @TheNateK I submitted a complaint via that link in Dec. &amp; followed up in Jan. NEVER HEARD BACK! #badcustomerservice
@americanair Greatest Newark Gate Agents ever: David Deane, Norma Sedholm and Luz Calderon just made me feel like a king. #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir flights been Cancelled Flightled, can't get through to the desk and nothing showing online under my reservation - what do I do?
@AmericanAir The point of the pic: If your reps struggle with the merger this much, imagine how it is for the public! http://t.co/hQdB5IRuVg
@AmericanAir flight was 2488 out of EWR STOP AT DALLAS THEN TO LA. I need to be in la tonight!
@AmericanAir I was flying from Ft Lauderdale FL to Seattle WA on the 02/28/2015 until the 03/03/2015 and they don't want to honor my flight.
@AmericanAir wasn't able to get on hold. Your system kept kicking me to the main menu.
@americanair Seattle check-in. 1 desk servicing full service line. 2 desks servicing priority. Full srvc wait 30+ minutes. Customer svc fail
@AmericanAir hey! Tried calling customer service and was told there's a 2 hour wait. This has been for the past 4 hours. Thanks! You suck!
@AmericanAir since we are leaving tomorrow to miami can you do one thing right and deliver the bags to the airport?
@AmericanAir but have been yet to receive assistance from one of your agents in securing a new connection. Many will now miss work tomorrow.
@AmericanAir @cheerUPDATES So you're saying the call center is understaffed?
@AmericanAir I've been trying to change frm AA 2401 to LAX at 6:50am MONDAY morning then AA 2586 from LAX to FAT to flight AA 1359?#helpAA
@AmericanAir are flights from Columbus Ohio to Dallas Texas Cancelled Flighted?
@AmericanAir @naomi_cooper Are you out of your mind, AA? What is the point of this Twitter acct? Form letters in 140 characters or less?
@AmericanAir  many have missed connections already b/c of delayed flight which will finally board soon
@AmericanAir On flt 1627 from DFW to FAT on 2/23 and it was 86'd. Can you rebook me on the 1359 flight tonight? Can't get through on phone.
@AmericanAir I wasn't important this morning when you would not seat my wife and I together or allow me to choose seats at Flight Booking Problems!!
@AmericanAir i dont believe it, it has been impossible for your agents to get an update from the delivery company since yesterday at 11 am
@AmericanAir yet there are plenty of available AA agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight.
@AmericanAir @BDinDallas The personal touch you're known for, AA. Other cool perks: blaming understaffing on weather. And 3 hr hold times.
@AmericanAir been waiting in line for over an hour in San Antonio, barely moved &amp; only two agents. 30 in front of me &amp; at least 40 behind.
@AmericanAir my return flight is scheduled on Wednesday; AA138 I believe.  Thanks for the help!
@AmericanAir. You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
@AmericanAir ....I am on attempt #6 and hour #10 of calling and being put on hold.  Not feeling confident that I will ever get through...
@AmericanAir bought a ticket on @SouthwestAir. After two days, your "team" couldn't share the data needed to get me to my next meeting.
@AmericanAir thanks for the response. I know it's not your fault... But Im in ORD in T5 and hungry if you want to stop by ‚úàÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
@AmericanAir cut it. Put me on a flt tomorrow.
@AmericanAir nah u boofin u dont talk like any humans i know. Respond like u actually have a brain. And again i dont want customer relations
@AmericanAir I have no transportation to and going to some other city and getting to NY sometime on Wed?! I'm sorry that's not gonna cut
@AmericanAir because of you, I am doing the one thing I tried to avoid. Thank you for sending me to baggage claim.
@AmericanAir my flt is at 7a tom. I have now rec'd notification that I'm going out from some other airport
@AmericanAir how does one book a ticket online and put it on hold?  Does that require that I pay for the ticket?
@AmericanAir can you help me with a reservation? cant get through on the phone
@AmericanAir ask the 10 people you left behind at Miami airport because you guys could not wait 5 minutes and ... http://t.co/XPM98Igqjn
@AmericanAir can you do anything to get #AA953 moving? Been almost 24 hrs and hundreds at jfk upset, tired and want to get to BA.
@AmericanAir more of the insane treatment by your customers
@americanair Help!  I need to speak to a live agent before I lose my online reservation being held.
@AmericanAir @_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It's a small airport, so whatever.
@AmericanAir is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies
@AmericanAir  Mad love http://t.co/4ojrSDWPkK NYC-
@AmericanAir thanks for forcing me to check -in my carry - on luggage. That is exactly why I spent extra money on "travel size" toiletries
@AmericanAir @ejacqui If you updated the screens, then people would know the Late Flightst info, good or bad. And that wouldn't work because...
@AmericanAir missing a full days of work thanks guys
@AmericanAir Trying to find out if flight #340 DFW to HOU is on tonight. Exec platinum desk not calling back and online info not clear.
.@AmericanAir I can't even get on the phone with your reservations team. The system automatically disconnects us.
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted and rebooked but agent made a mistake and booked wrong date! Been trying to get through via phone for hours!!
@AmericanAir @russelneiss No, American. This is simple. How about YOU call HER back with the info for her new flight. Basic customer service
@AmericanAir I have looked and I was told it was in Guatemala last night. No record of anywhere today. I need my clothing for work tomorrow.
@AmericanAir Cool, a canned response. Nah, I think I'll keep tweeting at everyone who mentions AA on Twitter. You could DM me, though.
@AmericanAir please fix your mobile and desktop site to allow Canadians to select a passenger when checking in. Thanks.
@AmericanAir tried ringing but told me to try again Late Flightr. I'm supposed to be leaving in an hour...
@AmericanAir You guys did an amazing job today! Know it‚Äôs hard; thanks to Kate Appleton for all her hard work reFlight Booking Problems my friends and me!
.@AmericanAir cover a rental car or refund our ticket? - I'll gladly drive 10 hrs home than be stuck here till Tues!
@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
@AmericanAir   You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
@AmericanAir yes and I would like a refund.
@AmericanAir how realistic is it to make an 80 minute domestic to international transfer at JFK for a non US citizen?
Eliza &amp; I cheated on u @AmericanAir with @AirTahitiNui &amp; it was a lovely flight. But we'll be back! Lots!
@AmericanAir I hope you like the photo :) http://t.co/p7fSLuxEGW
@AmericanAir @sweetmel If weather is bad, wouldn't your folks try extra hard to communicate...or load bags onto flight 1320...or...anything?
@AmericanAir and how is this not a mechanical issue? All evidence points to the idea that it‚Äôs the ILS at CLL at fault, not the weather.
@AmericanAir @CAexhibitions Sorry in, like, a general way? Or sorry that incompetence/understaffing is compounding weather issues?
@AmericanAir please help us get home tomorrow!!!!!
@AmericanAir @tennetexan Too bad there's only, like, 3 people on that team, then. Because this is next level unreal.
@AmericanAir @marxsterbcow How is this a real life response to a customer service issue? Seriously. Keep trying to call us. Eh, might work.
@AmericanAir fix the engine of flight AA3031so I don't spend all night in your airport so I can fly home tomorrow
@AmericanAir Thank you.....you do the same!!
@AmericanAir @ActingOutMgmnt Just make sure they remember to load the bags onto the plane. They Cancelled Flight the flight when they forget...
@AmericanAir @brewcrewfan8 Is this real life, AA? Like, 2015 real life? You should be emailing/calling/DMing people you've inconvenienced.
@AmericanAir hey there me again from yesterday im still on hold
@AmericanAir weather is unavoidable. Understaffing is controllable
@AmericanAir Not only was 5418 Late Flight, but we've been boarded and waiting for over 30min. WTF?
@AmericanAir @yvonneokaka When do I get my personal response and apology for your crew's having forgotten to load baggage onto my flight?
@AmericanAir All flts to JFK Cancelled Flightled Thx to UR agent at SFO Im rebooked on UA. Didn't get name. She was awesome!  #twitterhug #shesaidrun

@AmericanAir i was also told by agents my issues "aren't their prob" K fine. I get it. But have some compassion 4 others dealing w/this!!!
@AmericanAir What's the status at DFW? Ticket agent at gate A9 was very rude and unhelpful.

@AmericanAir I am trying to switch my flight to AA 1359 I am currently on AA 2401 at 6:50am MONDAY morn then AA 2586! Help Me!!
@AmericanAir I really hope it departs. They said is because the catering service wasnt available but we can see it next to plane doing nthin
@AmericanAir I understand weather is not your fault but ur cs reps are atrocious. I am NOT happy nor will I EVR fly w/ u again.
@AmericanAir When I left Orlando, I was 2nd in line for standby. I land and I'm 4th. 'Priority members get first available seats'. Awesome.
@AmericanAir You didn't respond to my DM. You tweeted the same canned tweet you're telling everyone else.
@AmericanAir I DMed you my AA &amp; phone #s &amp; you can't have someone call me? What was the point of your response? You didn't resolve anything!
@AmericanAir don't you guys have an email address? Just put me on the next available flight from ohare
@AmericanAir But Eagle is always Late Flight
@AmericanAir I have never on all my trips on any airline ever nat'l or int'l ever experienced anything like this!
@AmericanAir your call center won't let me wait on hold, which I would happily do. Am I seriously supposed to just keep calling? Not great
@AmericanAir half hour Late Flight leaving DFW...no attempt at an explanation
@AmericanAir I'm on flight 1027 tomorrow that got Cancelled Flightled. Need to find an alternative to get to Dallas. Please help.
@AmericanAir 30 minutes flight from OKC and then make us wait, 30 minutes cause the gate isn't empty.  #epicfail #poorplanning

@AmericanAir any earlier flights SAP-&gt;Mia &amp; Mia -&gt; New York (lga) on 03.03. I'm currently booked on flights 1504 and 1102.
@AmericanAir no hold times, just disconnections.   There is no excuse for that
.@AmericanAir nice 2 know. I paid 4 a seat. Then you sold my seat. now I bought a 3rd seat. It's a good scam, but a scam all the same.
@AmericanAir I‚Äôll play it by ear. I know that you are doing your best. Buy some chewey oatmeal cookies for your customer care folks.
@AmericanAir if business class if full but 1st class empty, do you guys upgrade EXP members to 1st?
@AmericanAir I've been trying for 4 hours to get hold of someone.
@AmericanAir thank you for quick responses.   #aa usually has fantastic customer service. That's why I was so shocked when it wasn't there
@AmericanAir what are my chances of making a connection to El Paso (AA504) with DFW from SAT (AA200) delayed 30 minutes?
@AmericanAir  beyond frustrated with no call back from auto hold or whatever you call it. Entered my number at 11:30 CST, still no call 2:26
@AmericanAir ahhhh your silence is golden now.  This tops it all.  Anyone get fired?
@AmericanAir Hey AA - can you help with an itinerary for a plat custy?  Stuck in PVR and phones aren't working
@AmericanAir @ShannonBloom Where's my DM? Where's my voucher? Who's paying my $70 cab and my $50 car back to JFK tomorrow?
@AmericanAir we've been on hold for hours.
@AmericanAir @Stone9956 Do you dislike delays when they're caused by YOUR crew forgetting to load bags &amp; lazy pilot wanting duty day to end?
@AmericanAir can you guys help me please?
@AmericanAir @travisamex It's not the weather. It's also gross incompetence. Understaffing. Crew forgetting to load bags. Don't duck truth.

@AmericanAir trying to book a flight on hold- can't get through to a representative on the phone- Advice?
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flights flights arbitrarily on same itinerary.  Weekend ruined for no good reason! No crew = missed Monday am mtg.
@AmericanAir i need someone to help me out
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled from Laguardia to Louisville Ky and i am  stuck at the airport. Do you guys compensate for this?
@AmericanAir &amp; if that wasn't enough, your staff have been so rude &amp; ignored passengers,don't think that should be accepted whatever reason
@AmericanAir I understand the weather issue but you can't expect passengers to wait 24 hours inside airports for whatever reason. Outrageous
@AmericanAir guarantee no retribution? If so, I'd be glad to share.
@AmericanAir a friend is having flight Cancelled Flightlations out of LAX to CMH on Feb 23. Anyway to help her? 800 number has been no help
@AmericanAir I used the "call back" feature with an operator regarding my flight, got a call 2 hours Late Flightr and got hung up on. #pleasehelp
@AmericanAir I need to be at work tomorrow at 8am, therefore that doesn't help.  Direct message faster than calling 800 number? #Backwards

@AmericanAir Cancelled Flights my flight, doesn't send an email, text or call. Then puts me on way earlier flight I might miss now. Thanks AA!
@AmericanAir DMing you now! Big thanks.
@AmericanAir 3078 is overweight so you pull 2 dozen passengers off? Why not luggage? Seriously?
