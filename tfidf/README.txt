Please replace the absolute paths of all files. Visit the tfidf.py file initially. "airline.nb" (line 98) will 
have its path in the naive bayes directory. In the classifier method, go to line 82 and change the term formula 
frequency formula to any of the formulas at the top of the file that you desire. If you are doing this, be sure 
to change the path of the output file on 113 to the path of the corresponding output file for the function call. 
For example, the function "tf_boolFreq" should map to the output file: "tfidf_boolFreq_predictions.txt". Finally, 
visit the accuracy.py file which is located in the parent directory and replace the file variable("mine")'s path 
with the path for the appropriate term frequency output file such as the file from the example above.
